flash point at or above 100°F (38°C). Combustible liquids shall 
be subdivided as follows: 



Class II. Liquids having a closed cup flash point at or above 
100°F (38°C) and below 140°F (60°C). 

Class IIIA. Liquids having a closed cup flash point at or 
above 140°F (60°C) and below 200°F (93°C). 

Class IIIB. Liquids having a closed cup flash point at or

which: 

1. Is a gas at 68°F (20°C) or less at 14.7 pounds per square 
inch atmosphere (psia) (101 kPa) of pressure; and 

2. Has a boiling point of 68°F (20°C) or less at 14.7 psia 
(101 kPa) which is either liquefied, nonliquefied or in 
solution, except those gases which have no other health- 
or physical-hazard properties are hot considered to be 
compressed until the pressure in the packaging exceeds 
41 psia (282 kPa) at 68°F (20°C). 

The states of a compressed gas are categorized as follows: 

1. Nonliquefied compressed gases are gases, other than 
those in solution, which are in a packaging under the 
charged pressure and are entirely gaseous at a tempera- 
ture of 68 °F (20°C). 

2. Liquefied compressed gases are gases that, in a packag- 
ing under the charged pressure, are partially liquid at a 
temperature of 68°F (20°C). 

3. Compressed gases in solution are nonliquefied gases that 
are dissolved in a solvent. 

4. Compressed gas mixtures consist of a mixture of two or 
more compressed gases contained in a packaging, the 
hazard properties of which are represented by the proper- 
ties of the mixture as a whole. 

CONTROL AREA. Spaces within a building where quanti- 
ties of hazardous materials not exceeding the maximum 
allowable quantities per control area are stored, dispensed, 
used or handled. See also the definition of "Outdoor control 
area" in the International Fire Code. 

CORROSIVE. A chemical that causes visible destruction of, 
or irreversible alterations in, living tissue by chemical action at 
the point of contact. A chemical shall be considered corrosive 
if, when tested on the intact skin of albino rabbits by the method 
described in DOTn 49 CFR, Part 173.137, such a chemical 
destroys or changes irreversibly the structure of the tissue at the 
point of contact following an exposure period of 4 hours. This 
term does not refer to action on inanimate surfaces. 

CRYOGENIC FLUID. A liquid having a boiling point lower 
than -150°F (-101°C) at 14.7 pounds per square inch atmo- 
sphere (psia) (an absolute pressure of 101 kPa).

DEFLAGRATION. An exothermic reaction, such as the 
extremely rapid oxidation of a flammable dust or vapor in air, 
in which the reaction progresses through the unbumed material 
at a rate less than the velocity of sound. A deflagration can have 
an explosive effect. 

DETACHED BUILDING. A separate single-story building, 
without a basement or crawl space, used for the storage or use 
of hazardous materials and located an approved distance from 
all structures. 

DETONATION. An exothermic reaction characterized by the 
presence of a shock wave in the material which establishes and 
maintains the reaction. The reaction zone progresses through 
the material at a rate greater than the velocity of souiid. The 
principal heating mechanism is one of shock compression. 
Detonations have an explosive effect. 

DISPENSING. The pouring or transferring of any material 
from a container, tank or similar vessel, whereby vapors, dusts, 
fumes, mists or gases are liberated to the atmosphere. 

EXPLOSIVE. Any chemical compound, mixture or device, 
the primary or common purpose of which is to function by 
explosion. The term includes, but is not limited to, dynamite, 
black powder, pellet powder, initiating explosives, detonators, 
safety fuses, squibs, detonating cord, igniter cord, igniters and 
display fireworks, 1.3G (Class B, Special). 

The term "explosive" includes any material determined to be 
within the scope of USC Title 18: Chapter 40 and also includes 
any material classified as an explosive other than consumer 
fireworks, 1 .40 (Class C, Common) by the hazardous materi- 
als regulations of DQTn 49 CFR. 

High explosive. Explosive material, such as dynamite, 
which can be caused to detonate by means of a No. 8 test 
blasting cap when unconfined. 



Low explosive. Explosive material that will bum or defla- 
grate when ignited. It is characterized by a rate of reaction 
that is less than the speed of sound. Examples of low explo- 
sives include, but are not limited to, black powder; safety 
fuse; igniters; igniter cord; fuse lighters; fireworks, 1.3G 
(Class B, Special) and propellants, 1.3C. 

Mass-detonating explosives. Division 1.1, 1.2 and 1.5 
explosives alone or in combination, or loaded into various 
types of ammunition or containers, most of which can be 
expected to explode virtually instantaneously when a small 
portion is subjected to fire, severe concussion, impact, the 
impulse of an initiating agent or the effect of a considerable 
discharge of energy from without. Materials that react in 
this manner represent a mass explosion hazard. Such an 
explosive will normally cause severe structural damage to 
adjacent objects. Explosive propagation could occur imme- 
diately to other items of ammunition and explosives stored 
sufficiently close to and not adequately protected from the 
initially exploding pile with a time interval short enough so 
that two or more quantities must be considered as one for 
quantity-distance purposes. 

UN/DOTn Class 1 explosives. The former classification 
system used by DQTn included the terms "high" and "low" 
explosives as defined herein. The following terms further 
define explosives under the current system applied by 
DQTn for all explosive materials defined as hazard Class 1 
materials. Compatibility group letters are used in concert 
with the division to specify further limitations on each divi- 
sion noted (i.e., the letter G identifies the material as a pyro- 
technic substance or article containing a pyrotechnic 
substance and similar materials). 

Division 1.1. Explosives that have a mass explosion haz- 
ard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the 
entire load instantaneously. 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE®

USE AND OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION 



Division 1.2. Explosives that have a projection hazard 
but not a mass explosion hazard. 

Division 1.3. Explosives that have a fire hazard and 
either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard 
or both, but not a mass explosion hazard. 

Division 1.4. Explosives that pose a minor explosion 
hazard. The explosive effects are largely confined to the 
package and no projection of fragments of appreciable 
size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not 
cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the 
entire contents of the package. 

Division 1.5. Very insensitive explosives. This division 
is comprised of substances that have a mass explosion 
hazard, but that are so insensitive there is very little prob- 
ability of initiation or of transition from burning to deto- 
nation under normal conditions of transport. 

Division 1.6. Extremely insensitive articles which do not 
have a mass explosion hazard. This division is comprised 
of articles that contain only extremely insensitive deto- 
nating substances and which demonstrate a negligible 
probability of accidental initiation or propagation. 

FIREWORKS. Any composition or device for the purpose of 
producing a visible or audible effect for entertainment pur- 
poses by combustion, deflagration or detonation that meets the

herein. 

FIREWORKS, 1.3G. (Formerly Class B, Special Fireworks.) 
Large fireworks devices, which are explosive materials, 
intended for use in fireworks displays and designed to produce 
audible or visible effects by combustion, deflagration or deto- 
nation. Such 1 .3G fireworks include, but are not limited to, fire- 
crackers containing more than 130 milligrams (2 grains) of 
explosive composition, aerial shells containing more than 40 
grams of pyrotechnic composition, and other display pieces 
which exceed the limits for classification as 1.4G fireworks. 
Such 1.3G fireworks are also described as fireworks, UN0335 
by the DOTn. 

FIREWORKS, 1.4G. (Formerly Class C, Common Fire- 
works.) Small fireworks devices containing restricted amounts 
of pyrotechnic composition designed primarily to produce vis- 
ible or audible effects by combustion. Such 1.4G fireworks 
which comply with the construction, chemical composition 
and labeling regulations of the DOTn for fireworks, UN0336, 
and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as 
set forth in CPSC 16 CFR: Parts 1500 and 1507, are not explo- 
sive materials for the purpose of this code. 

FLAMMABLE GAS. A material that is a gas at 68°F (20°C)

perature of 68°F (20°C) and which is flammable. 

FLAMMABLE LIQUID. A liquid having a closed cup flash 
point below 100°F (38°C). Flammable liquids are further cate- 
gorized into a group known as Class I liquids. The Class I cate- 
gory is subdivided as follows: 

Class lA. Liquids having a flash point below 73°F (23°C) 
and a boiling point below 100°F (38°C). 

Class IB. Liquids having a flash point below 73°F (23°C) 
and a boiling point at or above 100°F (38°C). 

Class IC. Liquids having a flash point at or above 73 °F 
(23°C) and below 100°F (38°C). 

The category of flammable liquids does not include com- 
pressed gases or cryogenic fluids. 

FLAMMABLE MATERIAL. A material capable of being 
readily ignited from common sources of heat or at a temperature 
of600°F(316°C)orless. 

FLAMMABLE SOLID. A sohd, other than a blasting agent or 
explosive, that is capable of causing fire through friction, 
absorption or moisture, spontaneous chemical change, or 
retained heat from manufacturing or processing, or which has an 
ignition temperature below 212°F (100°C) or which bums so 
vigorously and persistently when ignited as to create a serious 
hazard. A chemical shall be considered a flammable solid as 
determined in accordance with the test method of CPSC 16 
CFR; Part 1500.44, if it ignites and bums with a self-sustained 
flame at a rate greater than 0. 1 inch (2.5 mm) per second along its 
major axis. 

FLASH POINT. The minimum temperature in degrees Fahren- 
heit at which a Uquid will give off sufficient vapors to form an 
ignitable mixture with air near the surface or in the container, but 
will not sustain combustion. The flash point of a liquid shall be 
determined by appropriate test procedure and apparatus as spec- 
ified in ASTM D 56, ASTM D 93 or ASTM D 3278. 

HANDLING. The deUberate transport by any means to a point 
of storage or use. 

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Those chemicals or substances 
that are physical hazards or health hazards as defined and classi- 
fied in this section and the International Fire Code, whether the 
materials are in usable or waste condition. 

HEALTH HAZARD. A classification of a chemical for which 
there is statistically significant evidence that acute or chronic 
health effects are capable of occurring in exposed persons. The 
term "health hazard" includes chemicals that are toxic or highly 
toxic, and corrosive. 

HIGHLY TOXIC. A material which produces a lethal dose or 
lethal concentration that falls within any of the following catego- 
ries: 

1 . A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of 50 mil- 
hgrams or less per kilogram of body weight when admin-

USE AND OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION 



istered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 
grams each. 

2. A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of 200 
milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight when

death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of albino 
rabbits weighing between 2 and 3 kilograms each. 

3. A chemical that has a median lethal concentration (LC50) 
in air of 200 parts per milUon by volume or less of gas or

dust, when administered by continuous inhalation for 1 
hour (or less if death occurs within 1 hour) to albino rats 
weighing between 200 and 300 grams each. 

Mixtures of these materials with ordinary materials, such as 
water, might not warrant classification as highly toxic. While 
this system is basically simple in application, any hazard evalua- 
tion that is required for the precise categorization of this type of 
material shall be performed by experienced, technically compe- 
tent persons. 

INCOMPATIBLE MATERIALS. Materials that, when 
mixed, have the potential to react in a manner that generates 
heat, fumes, gases or byproducts which are hazardous to life or 
property. 

OPEN SYSTEM. The use of a solid or liquid hazardous mate- 
rial involving a vessel or system that is continuously open to the 
atmosphere during normal operations and where vapors are 
liberated, or the product is exposed to the atmosphere during 
normal operations. Examples of open systems for solids and 
liquids include dispensing from or into open beakers or con- 
tainers, dip tank and plating tank operations. 

OPERATING BUILDING. A building occupied in conjunc- 
tion with the manufacture, transportation or use of explosive 
materials. Operating buildings are separated from one another 
with the use of intraplant or intraline distances. 

ORGANIC PEROXIDE. An organic compound that contains 
the bivalent -0-0- structure and which may be considered to be 
a structural derivative of hydrogen peroxide where one or both 
of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by an organic radi- 
cal. Organic peroxides can pose an explosion hazard (detona- 
tion or deflagration) or they can be shock sensitive. They can 
also decompose into various unstable compounds over an 
extended period of time. 

Class I. Those formulations that are capable of deflagration 
but not detonation. 

Class II. Those formulations that bum very rapidly and that 
pose a moderate reactivity hazard.

hazard. 

Class V. Those formulations that bum with less intensity 
than ordinary combustibles or do not sustain combustion 
and that pose no reactivity hazard. 



Unclassified detonable. Organic peroxides that are capable 
of detonation. These peroxides pose an extremely high 
explosion hazard through rapid explosive decomposition. 

OXIDIZER. A material that readily yields oxygen or other 
oxidizing gas, or that readily reacts to promote or initiate com- 
bustion of combustible materials. Examples of other oxidizing 
gases include bromine, chlorine and fluorine. 

Class 4. An oxidizer that can undergo an explosive reaction 
due to contamination or exposure to thermal or physical 
shock. Additionally, the oxidizer will enhance the buming 
rate and can cause spontaneous ignition of combustibles. 

Class 3. An oxidizer that will cause a severe increase in the 
buming rate of combustible materials with which it comes 
in contact or that will undergo vigorous self-sustained 
decomposition due to contamination or exposure to heat. 

Class 2. An oxidizer that will cause a moderate increase in 
the buming rate or that causes spontaneous ignition of com- 
bustible materials with which it comes in contact. 

Class 1. An oxidizer whose primary hazard is that it slightly 
increases the buming rate but which does not cause sponta- 
neous ignition when it comes in contact with combustible 
materials. 

OXIDIZING GAS. A gas that can support and accelerate 
combustion of other materials. 

PHYSICAL HAZARD. A chemical for which there is evi- 
dence that it is a combustible liquid, compressed gas, cryo- 
genic, explosive, flammable gas, flammable liquid, flammable 
solid, organic peroxide, oxidizer, pyrophoric or unstable (reac- 
tive) or water-reactive material. 

PYROPHORIC. A chemical with an autoignition tempera- 
ture in air, at or below a temperature of 130°F (54.4°C).

initiated by ignition. 

TOXIC. A chemical falling within any of the following cate- 
gories: 

1 . A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of more 
than 50 milligrams per kilogram, but not more than 500 
milligrams per kilogram of body weight when adminis- 
tered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 
grams each. 

2. A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of more 
than 200 milligrams per kilogram but not more than 
1,000 milligrams per kilogram of body weight when 
administered by continuous contact for 24 hours (or less 
if death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of 
albino rabbits weighing between 2 and 3 kilograms each. 

3. A chemical that has a median lethal concentration (LC50) 
in air of more than 200 parts per million but not more 
than 2,000 parts per million by volume of gas or vapor, or

200 and 300 grams each. 

UNSTABLE (REACTIVE) MATERIAL. A material, other 
than an explosive, which in the pure state or as commercially 
produced, will vigorously polymerize, decompose, condense 
or become self-reactive and undergo other violent chemical 
changes, including explosion, when exposed to heat, friction or 
shock, or in the absence of an inhibitor, or in the presence of 
contaminants, or in contact with incompatible materials. 
Unstable (reactive) materials are subdivided as follows: 

Class 4. Materials that in themselves are readily capable of

CHAPTER 4 

SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED 
ON USE AND OCCUPANCY 



SECTION 401 
SCOPE 

401.1 Detailed use and occupancy requirements. In addition 
to the occupancy and construction requirements in this code, 
the provisions of this chapter apply to the special uses and 
occupancies described herein. 



SECTION 402 
COVERED MALL BUILDINGS 

402.1 Scope. The provisions of this section shall apply to 
buildings or structures defined herein as covered mall buildings 
not exceeding three floor levels at any point nor more than three 
stories above grade plane. Except as specifically required by 
this section, covered mall buildings shall meet applicable pro- 
visions of this code. 

Exceptions: 

1. Foyers and lobbies of Groups B, R-1 and R-2 are not 
required to comply with this section. 

2. Buildings need not comply with the provisions of this 
section when they totally comply with other applica- 
ble provisions of this code. 

402.2 Definitions. The following words and terms shall, for the 
purposes of this chapter and as used elsewhere in this code, 
have the meanings shown herein. 

ANCHOR BUILDING. An exterior perimeter building of a 
group other than H having direct access to a covered mall build- 
ing but having required means of egress independent of the 
mall. 

COVERED MALL BUILDING. A single building enclosing 
a number of tenants and occupants such as retail stores, drink- 
ing and dining establishments, entertainment and amusement 
facilities, passenger transportation terminals, offices, and other 
similar uses wherein two or more tenants have a main entrance 
into one or more malls. For the purpose of this chapter, anchor 
buildings shall not be considered as a part of the covered mall 
building. 

FOOD COURT. A public seating area located in the mall that 
serves adjacent food preparation tenant spaces. 

GROSS LEASABLE AREA. The total floor area designed 
for tenant occupancy and exclusive use. The area of tenant 
occupancy is measured from the centerlines of joint partitions 
to the outside of the tenant walls. All tenant areas, including 
areas used for storage, shall be included in calculating gross 
leasable area. 

MALL. A roofed or covered common pedestrian area within a 
covered mall building that serves as access for two or more ten- 
ants and not to exceed three levels that are open to each other. 



402.3 Lease plan. Each covered mall building owner shall pro- 
vide both the building and fire departments with a lease plan 
showing the location of each occupancy and its exits after the 
certificate of occupancy has been issued. No modifications or 
changes in occupancy or use shall be made from that shown on 
the lease plan without prior approval of the building official. 

402.4 Means of egress. Each tenant space and the covered mall 
building shall be provided with means of egress as required by 
this section and this code. Where there is a conflict between the 
requirements of this code and the requirements of this section, 
the requirements of this section shall apply. 

402.4.1 Determination of occupant load. The occupant 
load permitted in any individual tenant space in a covered 
mall building shall be determined as required by this code. 
Means of egress requirements for individual tenant spaces 
shall be based on the occupant load thus determined. 

402.4.1.1 Occupant formula. In determining required 
means of egress of the mall, the number of occupants for 
whom means of egress are to be provided shall be based 
on gross leasable area of the covered mall building 
(excluding anchor buildings) and the occupant load fac- 
tor as determined by the following equation. 



OLF= (0.00007) (GLA) + 25 
where: 



(Equation 4-1) 



OLF= The occupant load factor (square feet per per- 
son). 

GLA= The gross leasable area (square feet). 

402.4.1.2 OLE range. The occupant load factor (OLF) is 
not required to be less than 30 and shall not exceed 50. 

402.4.1.3 Anchor buildings. The occupant load of 
anchor buildings opening into the mall shall not be 
included in computing the total number of occupants for 
the mall. 

402.4.1.4 Food courts. The occupant load of a food 
court shall be determined in accordance with Section 
1004. For the purposes of determining the means of 
egress requirements for the mall, the food court occupant 
load shall be added to the occupant load of the covered 
mall building as calculated above. 

402.4.2 Number of means of egress. Wherever the dis- 
tance of travel to the mall from any location within a ten- 
ant space used by persons other than employees exceeds 
75 feet (22 860 mm) or the tenant space has an occupant 
load of 50 or more, not less than two means of egress shall 
be provided. 

402.4.3 Arrangements of means of egress. Assembly 
occupancies with an occupant load of 500 or more shall be 
so located in the covered mall building that their entrance

mall shall not be included in determining means of egress 
requirements for the mall. The path of egress travel of 
malls shall not exit through anchor buildings. Malls ter- 
minating at an anchor building where no other means of 
egress has been provided shall be considered as a 
dead-end mall. 

402.4.4 Distance to exits. Within each individual tenant 
space in a covered mall building, the maximum distance of 
travel from any point to an exit or entrance to the mall shall

K ={4 +[A X // ] + [A X ^J} (Equation5-l) 

where: 

Afl = Allowable area per story (square feet). 

At = Tabular area per story in accordance with Table 503 
(square feet). 

// = Area increase factor due to frontage as calculated in 
accordance with Section 506.2. 

Is = Area increase factor due to sprinkler protection as cal- 
culated in accordance with Section 506.3. 

506.1.1 Basements. A single basement that is not a story 
above grade plane need not be included in the total allow- 
able area, provided such basement does not exceed the area 
permitted for a building with no more than one story above 
grade plane. 

506.2 Frontage increase. Every building shall adjoin or have 
access to a public way to receive an area increase for frontage. 
Where a building has more than 25 percent of its perimeter on a 
public way or open space having a minimum width of 20 feet 
(6096 mm), the frontage increase shall be determined in accor- 
dance with the following: 



I If=[F/P-0.25]W/30 



(Equation 5-2) 



where: 



F 



P 

W 



= Area increase due to frontage.

with Section 506.2.1. 

506.2.1 Width limits. "W" must be at least 20 feet (6096 
mm). Where the value of W varies along the perimeter of the 
building, the calculation performed in accordance with 
Equation 5-2 shall be based on the weighted average of each 



portion of exterior wall and open space where the value of W 
is greater than or equal to 20 feet (6096 mm). Where W 
exceeds 30 feet (9144 mm), a value of 30 feet (9144 mm) 
shall be used in calculating the weighted average, regardless 
of the actual width of the open space. 

Exception: The quantity of Wdivided by 30 shall be per- 
mitted to be a maximum of 2 when the building meets all 
requirements of Section 507 except for compliance with 
the 60-foot (18 288 nun) public way or yard requirement,

SECTION 703 
FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS AND FIRE TESTS 

703.1 Scope. Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance 
shall conform to the requirements of this chapter. 

703.2 Fire-resistance ratings. The fire-resistance rating of 
building elements shall be determined in accordance with the 
test procedures set forth in ASTM E 1 19 or in accordance with 
Section 703.3. Where materials, systems or devices that have 
not been tested as part of a fire-resistance-rated assembly are 
incorporated into the assembly, sufficient data shall be made 
available to the building official to show that the required 
fire-resistance rating is not reduced. Materials and methods of 
construction used to protect joints and penetrations in 
fire-resistance-rated building elements shall not reduce the 
required fire-resistance rating. 

Exception: In determining the fire-resistance rating of exte- 
rior bearing walls, compliance with the ASTM E 1 19 crite- 
ria for unexposed surface temperature rise and ignition of 
cotton waste due to passage of flame or gases is required 
only for a period of time corresponding to the required 
fire-resistance rating of an exterior nonbearing wall with the 
same fire separation distance, and in a building of the same 
group. When the fire-resistance rating determined in accor- 
dance with this exception exceeds the fire-resistance rating 
determined in accordance with ASTM E 1 19, the fire expo- 
sure time period, water pressure, and application duration 
criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM E 119 shall be 
based upon the fire-resistance rating determined in accor- 
dance with this exception. 

703.2.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction. Interior walls 
and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall be 
tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the 
assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest duration 
obtained from the two tests conducted in compliance with 
ASTM E 1 19. When evidence is furnished to show that the 
wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to 
the furnace, subject to acceptance of the building official, 
the wall need not be subjected to tests from the opposite side 
(see Section 704.5 for exterior walls). 

703.2.2 Combustible components. Combustible aggre- 
gates are permitted in gypsum and portland cement concrete 
mixtures approved for fire-resistance-rated construction. 
Any approved component material or admixture is permit- 
ted in assembUes if the resulting tested assembly meets the 
fire-resistance test requirements of this code. 

703.2.3 Restrained classification. Fire-resistance-rated 
assembhes tested under ASTM E 119 shall not be consid- 
ered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory to the 
building official is furnished by the registered design pro- 
fessional showing that the construction qualifies for a 
restrained classification in accordance with ASTM E 119. 
Restrained construction shall be identified on the plans. 

703.3 Alternative methods for determining fire resistance. 

The application of any of the alternative methods listed in this 



90 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE® 



FIRE-RESISTANCE-RATED CONSTRUCTION 



section shall be based on the fire exposure and acceptance crite- 
ria specified in ASTM E 1 19. The required fire resistance of a 
building element shall be permitted to be established by any of 
the following methods or procedures: 

1. Fire-resistance designs documented in approved 
sources. 

2. Prescriptive designs of fire-resistance-rated building 
elements as prescribed in Section 720. 

3. Calculations in accordance with Section 721. 

4. Engineering analysis based on a comparison of building 
element designs having fire-resistance ratings as deter- 
mined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E 1 19. 

5. Alternative protection methods as allowed by Section 
104.11. 

703.4 Noncombustibility tests. The tests indicated in Sections 
703.4.1 and 703.4.2 shall serve as criteria for acceptance of 
building materials as set forth in Sections 602.2, 602.3 and 
602.4 in Type I, II, III and IV construction. The term 
"noncombustible" does not apply to the flame spread charac- 
teristics of interior finish or trim materials. A material shall not 
be classified as a noncombustible building construction mate- 
rial if it is subject to an increase in combustibility or flame 
spread beyond the limitations herein established through the 
effects of age, moisture or other atmospheric conditions. 

703.4.1 Elementary materials. Materials required to be 
noncombustible shall be tested in accordance with ASTM E 
136. 

703.4.2 Composite materials. Materials having a struc- 
tural base of noncombustible material as determined in 
accordance with Section 703.4.1 with a surfacing not more 
than 0.125 inch (3.18 mm) thick that has a flame spread 
index not greater than 50 when tested in accordance with 
ASTM E 84 shall be acceptable as noncombustible materi- 
als.

tively. Projections shall not extend beyond the distance deter- 
mined by the following two methods, whichever results in the 
lesser projection: 

1. A point one-third the distance to the lot line from an 
assumed vertical plane located where protected openings 
are required in accordance with Section 704.8. 

2. More than 12 inches (305 mm) into areas where open- 
ings are prohibited.

fire-retardant-treated wood or as required by Section 
1406.3. 

Exception: Type V construction shall be allowed for R-3 
occupancies. 

704.3 Buildings on the same lot. For the purposes of deter- 
mining the required wall and opening protection and roof-cov- 
ering requirements, buildings on the same lot shall be assumed 
to have an imaginary line between them. 

Where a new building is to be erected on the same lot as an 
existing building, the location of the assumed imaginary line 
with relation to the existing building shall be such that the exte- 
rior wall and opening protection of the existing building meet 
the criteria as set forth in Sections 704.5 and 704.8. 

Exception: Two or more buildings on the same lot shall 
either be regulated as separate buildings or shall be consid- 
ered as portions of one building if the aggregate area of such 
buildings is within the limits specified in Chapter 5 for a sin- 
gle building. Where the buildings contain different occu- 
pancy groups or are of different types of construction, the 
area shall be that allowed for the most restrictive occupancy 
or construction. 

704.4 Materials. Exterior walls shall be of materials permitted 
by the building type of construction. 

704.5 Fire-resistance ratings. Exterior walls shall be 
fire-resistance rated in accordance with Tables 601 and 602. 
The fire-resistance rating of exterior walls with a fire separa- 
tion distance of greater than 5 feet (1524 mm) shall be rated for 
exposure to fire from the inside. The fu-e-resistance rating of 
exterior walls with a fire separation distance of 5 feet (1524 
mm) or less shall be rated for exposure to fu-e from both sides. 

704.6 Structural stability. The wall shall extend to the height 
required by Section 704.1 1 and shall have sufficient structural 
stability such that it will remain in place for the duration of time 
indicated by the required fire-resistance rating. 

704.7 Unexposed surface temperature. Where protected 
openings are not limited by Section 704.8, the limitation on the 
rise of temperature on the unexposed surface of exterior walls 
as required by ASTM E 1 19 shall not apply. Where protected 
openings are limited by Section 704.8, the limitation on the rise 
of temperature on the unexposed surface of exterior walls as 
required by ASTM E 1 19 shall not apply provided that a cor- 
rection is made for radiation from the unexposed exterior wall 
surface in accordance with the following fonnula:

SECTION 720 
PRESCRIPTIVE FIRE RESISTANCE 

720.1 General. The provisions of this section contain prescrip- 
tive details of fire-resistance-rated building elements. The 



materials of construction Usted in Tables 720.1(1), 720.1(2), 
and 720.1(3) shall be assumed to have the fire-resistance rat- 
ings prescribed therein. Where materials that change the capac- 
ity for heat dissipation are incorporated into a 
fire-resistance-rated assembly, fire test results or other substan- 
tiating data shall be made available to the building official to 
show that the required fire-resistance-rating time period is not 
reduced. 

720.1.1 Thickness of protective coverings. The thickness 
of fire-resistant materials required for protection of struc- 
tural members shall be not less than set forth in Table 
720.1(1), except as modified in this section. The figures 
shown shall be the net thickness of the protecting materials 
and shall not include any hollow space in back of the protec- 
tion. 

720.1.2 Unit masonry protection. Where required, metal 
ties shall be embedded in bed joints of unit masonry for pro- 
tection of steel columns. Such ties shall be as set forth in 
Table 720.1(1) or be equivalent thereto. 

720.1.3 Reinforcement for cast-in-place concrete col- 
umn protection. Cast-in-place concrete protection for steel 
columns shall be reinforced at the edges of such members 
with wire ties of not less than 0. 1 8 inch (4.6 mm) in diameter 
wound spirally around the columns on a pitch of not more 
than 8 inches (203 mm) or by equivalent reinforcement. 

720.1.4 Plaster application. The finish coat is not required 
for plaster protective coatings where they comply with the 
design mix and thickness requirements of Tables 720.1(1), 
720.1(2) and 720.1(3).

bers having a single tendon or more than one tendon 
installed with equal concrete cover measured from the near- 
est surface, the cover shall not be less than that set forth in 
Table 720.1(1). For members having multiple tendons 
installed with variable concrete cover, the average tendon 
cover shall not be less than that set forth in Table 720.1(1), 
provided: 

1. The clearance from each tendon to the nearest 
exposed surface is used to determine the average 
cover. 

2. In no case can the clear cover for individual tendons 
be less than one-half of that set forth in Table 
720.1(1). A minimum cover of 0.75 inch (19.1 mm) 
for slabs and 1 inch (25 mm) for beams is required for 
any aggregate concrete. 

3. For the purpose of establishing a fire-resistance rat- 
ing, tendons having a clear covering less than that set 
forth in Table 720. 1(1) shall not contribute more than 
50 percent of the required ultimate moment capacity 
for members less than 350 square inches (0.226 m^) in 
cross-sectional area and 65 percent for larger mem- 
bers. For structural design purposes, however, ten- 
dons having a reduced cover are assumed to be fully 
effective.

ing of a layer of foam plastic insulation sandwiched 
between two wythes of concrete shall be permitted to 
be determined by use of Equation 7-4. Foam plastic 
insulation with a total thickness of less than 1 inch (25 
mm) shall be disregarded. The /?„ value for thickness 
of foam plastic insulation of 1 inch (25 mm) or 
greater, for use in the calculation, is 5 minutes; there- 
fore /?„059 = 2.5. 

721.2.1.3 Joints between precast wall panels. Joints 
between precast concrete wall panels which are not insu- 
lated as required by this section shall be considered as 
openings in walls. Uninsulated joints shall be included in 
determining the percentage of openings permitted by 
Table 704.8. Where openings are not permitted or are 
required by this code to be protected, the provisions of 
this section shall be used to determine the amount of joint 
insulation required. Insulated joints shall not be consid- 
ered openings for purposes of determining compliance 
with the allowable percentage of openings in Table 
704.8. 

721.2.1.3.1 Ceramic fiber joint protection. Figure 
721.2.1.3.1 shows thicknesses of ceramic fiber blan- 
kets to be used to insulate joints between precast con- 
crete wall panels for various panel thicknesses and for 
joint widths of % inch (9.5 mm) and 1 inch (25 mm) 



for fire-resistance ratings of 1 hour to 4 hours. For 
joint widths between Vg inch (9.5 mm) and 1 inch (25 
mm), the thickness of Ceramic fiber blanket is allowed 
to be determined by direct interpolation. Other tested 
and labeled materials are acceptable in place of 
ceramic fiber blankets. 

721.2.1.4 Walls with gypsum wallboard or plaster JBn- 
ishes. The fire-resistance rating of cast-in-place or pre- 
cast concrete walls with finishes of gypsum wallboard or 
plaster applied to one or both sides shall be permitted to 
be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this 
section. 

721.2.1.4.1 Nonfire-exposed side. Where the finish 
of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the side 
of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of the 
finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be deter- 
mined as follows: The thickness of the finish shall 
first be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness 
of the finish by the applicable factor determined from 
Table 721.2.1.4(1) based on the type of aggregate in 
the concrete. The corrected thickness of finish shall 
then be added to the actual or equivalent thickness of 
concrete and fire-resistance rating of the concrete and 
finish determined from Table 721.2.1.1, Figure 
721.2.1.2 or Table 721.2.1.2(1). 

721.2.1.4.2 Fire-exposed side. Where gypsum wall- 
board or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of 
the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total 
fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: 
The time assigned to the finish as estabUshed by Table 
721.2.1 .4(2) shall be added to the fire-resistance rating 
determined from Table 721.2.1.1 or Figure 721.2.1.2, 
or Table 721.2.1.2(1) for the concrete alone, or to the 
rating determined in Section 721.2.1.4.1 for the con- 
crete and finish on the nonfire-exposed side.

721.2.1.4.3 Nonsymmetrical assemblies. For a wall 
having no finish on one side or different types or 
thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation pro- 
cedures of Sections 721.2.1.4.1 and 721.2.1.4.2 shall 
be performed twice, assuming either side of the wall 
to be the fire-exposed side. The fire-restance rating of 
the wall shall not exceed the lower of the two values. 

Exception: For an exterior wall with more than 5 
feet (1524 mm) of horizontal separation, the fire 
shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only. 

721.2.1.4.4 Minimmn concrete fire-resistaiice rat- 
ing. Where finishes apphed to one or both sides of a 
concrete wall contribute to the fire-resistance rating, 
the concrete alone shall provide not less than one-half 
of the total required fire-resistance rating. Addition- 
ally, the contribution to the fire resistance of the finish 
on the nonfire-exposed side of a load-bearing wall shall 
not exceed one-half the contribution of the concrete 
alone. 

721.2.1.4.5 Concrete finishes. Finishes on concrete 
walls that are assumed to contribute to the total 
fire-resistance rating of the wall shall comply with the 
installation requirements of Section 721.3.2.5. 

721.2.2 Concrete floor and roof slabs. Reinforced and 
prestressed floors and roofs shall comply with Section 
721.2.2.1. Multicourse floors and roofs shall comply with

FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS FOR TWO-COURSE 

CONCRETE FLOORS 



721.2.2.3 Multicourse roofs. The fire-resistance ratings 
of roofs which consist of a base slab of concrete with a 
topping (overlay) of an insulating concrete or with an 
insulating board and built-up roofing shall comply with 
Figures 721.2.2.3(1) and 721.2.2.3(2). 

721.2.2.3.1 Heat transfer. For the transfer of heat, 
three-ply built-up roofing contributes 10 minutes to 
the fire-resistance rating. The fire-resistance rating 
for concrete assemblies such as those shown in Figure 
721.2.2.3(1) shall be increased by 10 minutes. This 
increase is not applicable to those shown in Figure 
721.2.2.3(2). 

721.2.2.4 Joints in precast slabs. Joints between adja- 
cent precast concrete slabs need not be considered in cal- 
culating the slab thickness provided that a concrete 
topping at least 1 inch (25 mm) thick is used. Where no 
concrete topping is used, joints must be grouted to a 
depth of at least one-third the slab thickness at the joint, 
but not less than 1 inch (25 mm), or the joints must be 
made fixe resistant by other approved methods. 

721.2.3 Concrete cover over reinforcement. The mini- 
mum thickness of concrete cover over reinforcement in con- 
crete slabs, reinforced beams and prestressed beams shall 
comply with this section. 



721.2.3.1 Slab cover. The minimum thickness of con- 
crete cover to the positive moment reinforcement shall 
comply with Table 721.2.3(1) for reinforced concrete 
and Table 721.2.3(2) for prestressed concrete. These 
tables are applicable for solid or hollow-core one-way or 
two-way slabs with flat undersurfaces. These tables are 
applicable to slabs that are either cast in place or precast. 
For precast prestressed concrete not covered elsewhere, 
the procedures contained in PCI MNL 124 shall be 
acceptable. 

721.2.3.2 Reinforced beam cover. The minimum thick- 
ness of concrete cover to the positive moment reinforce- 
ment (bottom steel) for reinforced concrete beams is 
shown in Table 721.2.3(3) for fire-resistance ratings of 1 
hour to 4 hours. 

721.2.3.3 Prestressed beam cover. The minimum thick- 
ness of concrete cover to the positive moment 
prestressing tendons (bottom steel) for restrained and 
unrestrained prestressed concrete beams and stemmed 
units shall comply with the values shown in Tables 
721.2.3(4) and 721.2.3(5) for fire-resistance ratings of 1 
hour to 4 hours. Values in Table 721.2.3(4) apply to 
beams 8 inches (203 mm) or greater in width. Values in 
Table 721.2.3(5) apply to beams or stems of any width, 
provided the cross-section area is not less than 40 square 
inches (25 806 mm^). In case of differences between the 
values determined from Table 721.2.3(4) or 721.2.3(5), 
it is permitted to use the smaller value. The concrete 
cover shall be calculated in accordance with Section 
721.2.3.3.1. The minimum concrete cover for 
nonprestressed reinforcement in prestressed concrete 
beams shall comply with Section 721.2.3.2. 

721.2.3.3.1 Calculating concrete cover. The con- 
crete cover for an individual tendon is the minimum 
thickness of concrete between the surface of the ten- 
don and the fire-exposed surface of the beam, except 
that for ungrouped ducts, the assumed cover thick- 
ness is the minimum thickness of concrete between 
the surface of the duct and the fire-exposed surface 
of the beam. For beams in which two or more ten- 
dons are used, the cover is assumed to be the average 
of the minimum cover of the individual tendons. For 
corner tendons (tendons equal distance from the bot- 
tom and side), the minimum cover used in the calcu- 
lation shall be one-half the actual value. For 
stemmed members with two or more prestressing 
tendons located along the vertical centerline of the 
stem, the average cover shall be the distance from the 
bottom of the member to the centroid of the tendons. 
The actual cover for any individual tendon shall not 
be less than one-half the smaller value shown in 
Tables 721 .2.3(4) and 72 1 .2.3(5), or 1 inch (25 mm), 
whichever is greater.

ness of the concrete masonry unit, T^, as determined by 
Section 721.3.1.2, 721.3.1.3, or 721.3.1.4, plus the 
equivalent thickness of finishes, T^p determined in accor- 
dance with Section 721.3.2: 

T,„ = T, + T,f (Equation 7-6) 

T^=V„/LH= Equivalent thickness of concrete 
masonry unit (inch) (mm). 

where: 

V„ = Net volume of masonry unit (inch^) (mm^). 

L = Specified length of masonry unit (inch) (mm). 

H = Specified height of masonry unit (inch) (mm). 

721.3.1.2 Ungrouted or partially grouted construc- 
tion. T^ shall be the value obtained for the concrete 
masonry unit determined in accordance with ASTM C 
140. 

721.3.1.3 Solid grouted construction. The equivalent 
thickness, T^, of solid grouted concrete masonry units is 
the actual thickness of the unit. 

721.3.1.4 Airspaces and cells filled with loose-fill 
material. The equivalent thickness of completely filled 
hollow concrete masonry is the actual thickness of the 
unit when loose-fill materials are: sand, pea gravel, 
crushed stone, or slag that meet ASTM C 33 require- 
ments; pumice, scoria, expanded shale, expanded clay, 
expanded slate, expanded slag, expanded fly ash, or cin- 
ders that comply with ASTM C 33 1 ; or perlite or vermic- 
ulite meeting the requirements of ASTM C 549 and 
ASTM C 516, respectively. 

721.3.2 Concrete masonry walls. The fire-resistance rat- 
ing of walls and partitions constructed of concrete masonry 
units shall be determined from Table 721.3.2. The rating 
shall be based on the equivalent thickness of the masonry 
and type of aggregate used. 

721.3.2.1 Finish on nonfire-exposed side. Where plas- 
ter or gypsum wallboard is applied to the side of the wall 
not exposed to fire, the contribution of the finish to the 
total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as fol- 
lows: The thickness of gypsum wallboard or plaster shall 
be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness of the 
finish by applicable factor determined from Table 
721.2.1.4(1). This corrected thickness of finish shall be 
added to the equivalent thickness of masonry and the 
fire-resistance rating of the masonry and finish deter- 
mined from Table 721.3.2. 

721.3.2.2 Finish on fire-exposed side. Where plaster or 
gypsum wallboard is applied to the fire-exposed side of 
the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total 
fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The 
time assigned to the finish as established by Table 
721.2.1.4(2) shall be added to the fire-resistance rating 
determined in Section 721.3.2 for the masonry alone, or 
in Section 721.3.2.1 for the masonry and finish on the 
nonfire-exposed side.

d. Minimum required equivalent thickness corresponding to the hourly fire-resistance rating for units with a combination of aggregate shall be determined by linear 
interpolation based on the percent by volume of each aggregate used in manufacture. 



721.3.2.3 Nonsymmetrical assemblies. For a wall hav- 
ing no finish on one side or having different types or 
thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation proce- 
dures of this section shall be performed twice, assuming 
either side of the wall to be the fire-exposed side. The 
fire-resistance rating of the wall shall not exceed the 
lower of the two values calculated. 

Exception: For exterior walls with more than 5 feet 
(1524 mm) of horizontal separation, the fire shall be 
assumed to occur on the interior side only. 

721.3.2.4 Minimum concrete masonry fire-resistance 
rating. Where the finish applied to a concrete masonry 
wall contributes toils fire-resistance rating, the masonry 
alone shall provide not less than one-half the total 
required fire-resistance rating. 

721.3.2.5 Attachment of finishes. Installation of fin- 
ishes shall be as follows: 

1. Gypsum wallboard and gypsum lath applied to 
concrete masonry or concrete walls shall be 
secured to wood or steel furring members spaced 
not more than 16 inches (406 mm) on center (o.c). 

2. Gypsum wallboard shall be installed with the long 
dimension parallel to the furring members and 
shall have all joints finished. 

3. Other aspects of the installation of finishes shall 
comply with the applicable provisions of Chapters 
7 and 25. 

721.3.3 Multiwythe masonry walls. The fire-resistance 
rating of wall assemblies constructed of multiple wythes of 
masonry materials shall be permitted to be based on the 
fire-resistance rating period of each wythe and the continu- 
ous airspace between each wythe in accordance with the fol- 
lowing formula: 



Rj, = (/?iO-59 + R^o-59 + 



-l-i?„o-59-HAi-i-A2 + ... +A„)i 



(Equation 7-7) 



where: 

Ra = Fire-resistance rating of the assembly (hours). 



R,, R2, ..., Rn = Fire-resistance rating of wythes for 1,2, n 
(hours), respectively. 

A], A2, ...., A„ = 0.30, factor for each continuous airspace 
for 1, 2, ...72, respectively, having a depth of 
V2 inch (12.7 mm) or more between 
wythes. 

721.3.4 Concrete masonry lintels. Fire-resistance ratings for 
concrete masonry lintels shall be determined based upon the 
nominal thickness of the Hntel and the minimum thickness of 
concrete masonry or concrete, or any combination thereof, 
covering the main reinforcing bars, as determined accord- 
ing to Table 721.3.4, or by approved alternate methods.

structural steel beams and girders which differ in size 
from that specified in approved fire-resistance-rated 
assemblies as a function of the thickness of fire-resistant 
material and the weight (W) and heated perimeter (D) of 
the beam or girder. As used in these sections, W is the 
average weight of a structural steel member in pounds 
per linear foot (plf). The heated perimeter, D, is the inside 
perimeter of the fire-resistant material in inches as illus- 
trated in Figure 721.5.2.

d = Depth of a wide flange column, outside diameter of pipe column, or 

outside dimension of structural tubing column (inches). 
t^^= Thickness of web of wide flange column (inches). 
w = Width of flange of wide flange column (inches). 



721.5.2.1.1 Weight-to-heated perimeter. The 

weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D), for both 
contour and box fire-resistant protection profiles, for 
the wide flange shapes most often used as beams or 
girders are given in Table 721.5.1(4). For different 
shapes, the weight-to-heated-perimeter ratios (W/D) 
shall be determined in accordance with the definitions 
given in this section. 

721.5.2.1.2 Beam and girder substitutions. Except 
as provided for in Section 721.5.2.2, structural steel 
beams in approved fire-resistance-rated assemblies 
shall be considered the minimum permissible size. 
Other beam or girder shapes shall be permitted to be 
substituted provided that the weight-to-heated-perim- 
eter ratio (W/D) of the substitute beam is equal to or 
greater than that of the beam specified in the approved 
assembly.

FIRE-RESISTANCE-RATED CONSTRUCTION 



721.5.2.2 Spray-applied fire-resistant materials. The 

provisions in this section apply to structural steel beams 
and girders protected with spray-applied fire-resistant 
materials. Larger or smaller beam and girder shapes shall 
be permitted to be substituted for beams specified in 
approved unrestrained or restrained fire-resistance-rated 
assemblies, provided the thickness of the fire-resistant 
material is adjusted in accordance with the following 
expression: 

hi = K [(^1 / ^1 ) + 0-60] / [(^2 / £&gt;2 ) + 0-60] 



(Equation 7-17) 



where: 



h = Thickness of spray-applied fire-resistant material 
in inches. 

W = Weight of the structural steel beam or girder in 
pounds per linear foot. 

D = Heated perimeter of the structural steel beam in 
inches. 

Subscript 1 refers to the beam and fire-resistant mate- 
rial thickness in the approved assembly. 

Subscript 2 refers to the substitute beam or girder and 
the required thickness of fire-resistant material. 

The fire resistance of structural steel beams and gird- 
ers protected with intumescent or mastic fire-resistant 
coatings shall be determined on the basis of fire-resis- 
tance tests in accordance with Section 703.2. 

721.5.2.2.1 Minimum thicl^ness. The use of Equa- 
tion 7-17 is subject to the following conditions: 

1. The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio for the 
substitute beam or girder (Wj/Dj) shall not be 
less than 0.37. 

2. The thickness of fire protection materials calcu- 
lated for the substitute beam or girder (Tj) shall 
not be less than Vg inch (9.5 mm). 

3. The unrestrained or restrained beam rating shall 
not be less than 1 hour. 

4i When used to adjust the material thickness for a 
restrained beam, the use of this procedure is 
limited to steel sections classified as compact in 
accordance with the AISC Specification for 
Structural Steel Buildings, (AISC-LRFD). 

721.5.2.3 Structural steel trusses. The fire resistance of 
structural steel trusses protected with fire-resistant mate- 
rials spray-applied to each of the individual truss ele- 
ments shall be permitted to be determined in accordance 
with this section. The thickness of the fire-resistant mate- 
rial shall be determined in accordance with Section 
721.5.1.3. The weight-to-heated-perimeter ratio (W/D) 
of truss elements that can be simultaneously exposed to 
fire on all sides shall be determined on the same basis as 



columns, as specified in Section 721.5.1.1. The 
weight- to-heated-perimeter ratio (WZ)) of truss ele- 
ments that directly support floor or roof construction 
shall be determined on the same basis as beams and gird- 
ers, as specified in Section 721.5.2.1. 

The fire resistance of structural steel trusses protected 
with intumescent or mastic fire-resistant coatings shall 
be determined on the basis of fire-resistance tests in 
accordance with Section 703.2. 

721.6 Wood assemblies. The provisions of this section contain 
procedures by which the fire-resistance ratings of wood assem- 
blies are established by calculations. 

721.6.1 General. This section contains procedures for cal- 
culating the fire-resistance ratings of walls, floor/ceiling 
and roof/ceiling assemblies based in part on the standard 
method of testing referenced in Section 703.2. 

721.6.1.1 Maximum fire-resistance rating. Fire-resis- 
tance ratings calculated using the procedures in this sec- 
tion shall be used only for 1-hour rated assemblies. 

721.6.1.2 Dissimilar membranes. Where dissimilar 
membranes are used on a wall assembly, the calculation 
shall be made from the least fire-resistant (weaker) side. 

721.6.2 Walls, floors and roofs. These procedures apply to 
both load-bearing and nonload-bearing assemblies. 

721.6.2.1 Fire-resistance rating of wood frame assem- 
blies. The fire-resistance rating of a wood frame assem- 
bly is equal to the sum of the time assigned to the 
membrane on the fire-exposed side, the time assigned to 
the framing members and the time assigned for addi- 
tional contribution by other protective measures such as 
insulation. The membrane on the unexposed side shall 
not be included in determining the fire resistance of the 
assembly. 

721.6.2.2 Time assigned to membranes. Table 
721.6.2(1) indicates the time assigned to membranes on 
the fire-exposed side. 

721.6.2.3 Exterior walls. For an exterior wall having 
more than 5 feet ( 1 524 mm) of horizontal separation, the 
wall is assigned a rating dependent on the interior mem- 
brane and the framing as described in Tables 721.6.2(1) 
and 721.6.2(2). The membrane on the outside of the 
nonfire-exposed side of exterior walls having more than 
5 feet (1524 mm) of horizontal separation may consist of 
sheathing, sheathing paper, and siding as described in 
Table 721.6.2(3). 

721.6.2.4 Floors and roofs. In the case of a floor or roof, 
the standard test provides only for testing for fire expo- 
sure from below. Except as noted in Section 703.3, Item 
5, floor or roof assemblies of wood framing shall have an 
upper membrane consisting of a subfloor and finished 
floor conforming to Table 721 .6.2(4) or any other mem- 
brane that has a contribution to fire resistance of at least 
15 minutes in Table 721.6.2(1).

materials used as interior finishes, trim and decorative materi- 
als. 

801.1.1 Interior finishes. These provisions shall limit the 
allowable flame spread and smoke development based on 
location and occupancy classification. 

Exceptions: 

1. Materials having a thickness less than 0.036 inch 
(0.9 mm) applied directly to the surface of walls or 
ceilings. 

2. Exposed portions of structural members comply- 
ing with the requirements for buildings of Type IV 
construction in Section 602.4 shall not be subject 
to interior finish requirements. 

801.1.2 Decorative materials and trim. Decorative mate- 
rials and trim shall be restricted by combustibility and the 
flame propagation performance criteria of NFPA 701, in 
accordance with Section 806. 

801.1.3 Applicability. For buildings in flood hazard areas 
as established in Section 1612.3, interior finishes, trim and 
decorative materials below the design flood elevation shall 
be flood-damage-resistant materials. 

801.2 Application. Combustible materials shall be permitted 
to be used as finish for walls, ceilings, floors and other interior 
surfaces of buildings. 

801.2.1 Windows. Show windows in the exterior walls of 
the first story above grade shall be permitted to be of wood 
or of unprotected metal framing. 

801.2.2 Foam plastics. Foam plastics shall not be used as 
interior finish or trim except as provided in Section 2603.9

expressed as a dimensionless number, derived from visual 
measurements of the spread of flame versus time for a material 
tested in accordance with ASTM E 84. 

INTERIOR FINISH. Interior finish includes interior wall and 
ceiling finish and interior floor finish. 

INTERIOR FLOOR FINISH. The exposed floor surfaces of 
buildings including coverings applied over a finished floor or 
stair, including risers. 

INTERIOR WALL AND CEILING FINISH. The exposed 
interior surfaces of buildings, including but not limited to: 
fixed or movable walls and partitions; toilet room privacy parti- 
tions; columns; ceilings; and interior wainscoting, paneling or 
other finish applied structurally or for decoration, acoustical

SECTION 909 
SMOKE CONTROL SYSTEMS 

[F] 909.1 Scope and purpose. This section applies to mechan- 
ical or passive smoke control systems when they are required 
by other provisions of this code. The purpose of this section is 
to establish minimum requirements for the design, installation 
and acceptance testing of smoke control systems that are 
intended to provide a tenable environment for the evacuation or 
relocation of occupants. These provisions are not intended for 
the preservation of contents, the timely restoration of opera- 
tions or for assistance in fire suppression or overhaul activities. 
Smoke control systems regulated by this section serve a differ- 
ent purpose than the smoke- and heat- venting provisions found 
in Section 910. Mechanical smoke control systems shall not be 
considered exhaust systems under Chapter 5 of the Interna- 
tional Mechanical Code. 

[F] 909.2 General design requirements. Buildings, structures 
or parts thereof required by this code to have a smoke control 
system or systems shall have such systems designed in accor- 
dance with the applicable requirements of Section 909 and the 
generally accepted and well-established principles of engi- 
neering relevant to the design. The construction documents 
shall include sufficient information and detail to adequately 
describe the elements of the design necessary for the proper 
implementation of the smoke control systems. These docu- 
ments shall be accompanied by sufficient information and 
analysis to demonstrate compliance with these provisions. 

[F] 909.3 Special inspection and test requirements. In addi- 
tion to the ordinary inspection and test requirements which 
buildings, structures and parts thereof are required to undergo, 
smoke control systems subject to the provisions of Section 909 
shall undergo special inspections and tests sufficient to verify 
the proper commissioning of the smoke control design in its 
final installed condition. The design submission accompany- 
ing the construction documents shall clearly detail procedures 
and methods to be used and the items subject to such inspec- 
tions and tests. Such commissioning shall be in accordance 
with generally accepted engineering practice and, where possi- 
ble, based on published standards for the particular testing 
involved. The special inspections and tests required by this sec- 
tion shall be conducted under the same terms in Section 1704. 

[F] 909.4 Analysis. A rational analysis supporting the types of 
smoke control systems to be employed, their methods of opera- 
tion, the systems supporting them and the methods of construc- 
tion to be utilized shall accompany the submitted construction 
documents and shall include, but not be limited to, the items 
indicated in Sections 909.4.1 through 909.4.6. 

[F] 909.4.1 Stack effect. The system shall be designed such 
that the maximum probable normal or reverse stack effect 
will not adversely interfere with the system's capabilities. In 
determining the maximum probable stack effect, altitude, 
elevation, weather history and interior temperatures shall be 
used.

[F] 909.5.1 Leakage area. The total leakage area of the bar- 
rier is the product of the smoke barrier gross area multiplied 
by the allowable leakage area ratio, plus the area of other 
openings such as gaps and operable windows. Compliance 
shall be determined by achieving the minimum air pressure 
difference across the barrier with the system in the smoke 
control mode for mechanical smoke control systems. Pas- 
sive smoke control systems tested using other approved 
means such as door fan testing shall be as approved by the

the smoke control system shall be designed to achieve pres- 
sure differences at least two times the maximum calculated 
pressure difference produced by the design fire. 

[F] 909.6.2 Maximum pressure difference. The maxi- 
mum air pressure difference across a smoke barrier shall be 
determined by required door-opening or closing forces. The 
actual force required to open exit doors when the system is 
in the smoke control mode shall be in accordance with Sec- 
tion 1008.1.2. Opening and closing forces for other doors 
shall be determined by standard engineering methods for 
the resolution of forces and reactions. The calculated force 
to set a side-hinged, swinging door in motion shall be deter- 
mined by:

SECTION 1004 
OCCUPANT LOAD 

1004.1 Design occupant load. In determining means of egress 
requirements, the number of occupants for whom means of 
egress facilities shall be provided shall be determined in accor- 
dance with this section. Where occupants from accessory areas 
egress through a primary space, the calculated occupant load 
for the primary space shall include the total occupant load of 
the primary space plus the number of occupants egressing 
through it from the accessory area. 

1004.1.1 Areas without fixed seating. The number of 
occupants shall be computed at the rate of one occupant per 
unit of area as prescribed in Table 1004. 1.1. For areas with- 
out fixed seating, the occupant load shall not be less than 
that number determined by dividing the floor area under 
consideration by the occupant per unit of area factor 
assigned to the occupancy as set forth in Table 1004.1.1. 
Where an intended use is not Usted in Table 1004.1.1, the 
building official shall establish a use based on a listed use 
that most nearly resembles the intended use. 

Exception: Where approved by the building official, the 
actual number of occupants for whom each occupied 
space, floor or building is designed, although less than 
those determined by calculation, shall be permitted to be 
used in the determination of the design occupant load. 

1004.2 Increased occupant load. The occupant load permitted in 
any building, or portion thereof, is permitted to be increased from 
that number established for the occupancies in Table 1004.1.1, 
provided that all other requirements of the code are also met 
based on such modified number and the occupant load does not 
exceed one occupant per 7 square feet (0.65 m^) of occupiable 
floor space. Where required by the building official, an approved 
aisle, seating or fixed equipment diagram substantiating any 
increase in occupant load shall be submitted. Where required by 
the building official, such diagram shall be posted. 

1004.3 Posting of occupant load. Every room or space that is 
an assembly occupancy shall have the occupant load of the 
room or space posted in a conspicuous place, near the main exit 
or exit access doorway from the room or space. Posted signs 
shall be of an approved legible permanent design and shall be 
maintained by the owner or authorized agent. 

1004.4 Exiting from multiple levels. Where exits serve more 
than one floor, only the occupant load of each floor considered 
individually shall be used in computing the required capacity 
of the exits at that floor, provided that the exit capacity shall not 
decrease in the direction of egress travel. 

1004.5 Egress convergence. Where means of egress from 
floors above and below converge at an intermediate level, the 
capacity of the means of egress from the point of convergence 
shall not be less than the sum of the two floors.

1004.6 Mezzanine levels. The occupant load of a mezzanine 
level with egress onto a room or area below shall be added to 
that room or area's occupant load, and the capacity of the exits 
shall be designed for the total occupant load thus established. 

1004.7 Fixed seating. For areas having fixed seats and aisles, 
the occupant load shall be determined by the number of fixed 
seats installed therein. The occupant load for areas in which 
fixed seating is not installed, such as waiting spaces and wheel- 
chair spaces, shall be determined in accordance with Section 
1004.1.1 and added to the number of fixed seats. 

For areas having fixed seating without dividing arms, the 
occupant load shall not be less than the number of seats based 
on one person for each 1 8 inches (457 mm) of seating length. 

The occupant load of seating booths shall be based on one 
person for each 24 inches (610 mm) of booth seat length mea- 
sured at the backrest of the seating booth. 

1004.8 Outdoor areas. Yards, patios, courts and similar out- 
door areas accessible to and usable by the building occupants 
shall be provided with means of egress as required by this chap- 
ter. The occupant load of such outdoor areas shall be assigned 
by the building official in accordance with the anticipated use. 
Where outdoor areas are to be used by persons in addition to the 
occupants of the building, and the path of egress travel from the 
outdoor areas passes through the building, means of egress 
requirements for the building shall be based on the sum of the 
occupant loads of the building plus the outdoor areas. 

Exceptions: 

1. Outdoor areas used exclusively for service of the 
building need only have one means of egress. 

2. Both outdoor areas associated with Group R-3 and 
individual dwelling units of Group R-2. 

1004.9 Multiple occupancies. Where a building contains two 
or more occupancies, the means of egress requirements shall 
apply to each portion of the building based on the occupancy of 
that space. Where two or more occupancies utilize portions of 
the same means of egress system, those egress components 
shall meet the more stringent requirements of all occupancies 
that are served. 



SECTION 1005 
EGRESS WIDTH 

1005.1 Minimum required egress width. The means of 
egress width shall not be less than required by this section. The 
total width of means of egress in inches (mm) shall not be less 
than the total occupant load served by the means of egress mul- 
tiplied by the factors in Table 1005. 1 and not less than specified 
elsewhere in this code. Multiple means of egress shall be sized 
such that the loss of any one means of egress shall not reduce 
the available capacity to less than 50 percent of the required 
capacity. The maximum capacity required from any story of a 
building shall be maintained to the termination of the means of 
egress. 

Exception: Means of egress complying with Section 1025.

and supported by a structure without additional independent 
supports.

Diaphragm, blocked. In light-frame construction, a dia- 
phragm in which all sheathing edges not occurring on a 
framing member are supported on and fastened to blocking.

tion where shear is transferred into or out of the diaphragm 
sheathing. Transfer is either to a boundary element or to 
another force-resisting element. 

Diaphragm chord. A diaphragm boundary element per- 
pendicular to the applied load that is assumed to take axial 
stresses due to the diaphragm moment. 

Diaphragm flexible. A diaphragm is flexible for the pur- 
pose of distribution of story shear and torsional moment 
where so indicated in Section 12.3. 1 of ASCE 7, as modified 
in Section 1613.6.1. 



Diaphragm, rigid. A diaphragm is rigid for the purpose of 
distribution of story shear and torsional moment when the 
lateral deformation of the diaphragm is less than or equal to 
two times the average story drift. 

DURATION OF LOAD. The period of continuous appUca- 
tion of a given load, or the aggregate of periods of intermittent 
applications of the same load.

that are intended to remain operational in the event of extreme 
environmental loading from flood, wind, snow or earthquakes. 

FABRIC PARTITIONS. A partition consisting of a finished 
surface made of fabric, without a continuous rigid backing, that

elevators, craneways, vehicles and other similar forces and 
kinetic loads, pressure and possible surcharge from fixed or 
moving loads. 

LIMIT STATE. A condition beyond which a structure or 
member becomes unfit for service and is judged to be no longer 
useful for its intended function (serviceability limit state) or to 
be unsafe (strength limit state). 

LIVE LOADS. Those loads produced by the use and occu- 
pancy of the building or other structure and do not include con- 
struction or environmental loads such as wind load, snow load, 
rain load, earthquake load, flood load or dead load. 

LIVE LOADS (ROOF). Those loads produced (1) during 
maintenance by workers, equipment and materials; and (2) 
during the life of the structure by movable objects such as 
planters and by people. 

LOAD AND RESISTANCE FACTOR DESIGN (LRFD). A 

method of proportioning structural members and their connec- 
tions using load and resistance factors such that no applicable 
limit state is reached when the structure is subjected to appro- 
priate load combinations. The term "LRFD" is used in the 
design of steel and wood structures. 

LOAD EFFECTS. Forces and deformations produced in 
structural members by the applied loads. 

LOAD FACTOR. A factor that accounts for deviations of the 
actual load from the nominal load, for uncertainties in the anal- 
ysis that transforms the load into a load effect, and for the prob- 
ability that more than one extreme load will occur 
simultaneously. 

LOADS. Forces or other actions that result from the weight of 
building materials, occupants and their possessions, environ-

tions of the actual strength from the nominal strength and the 
manner and consequences of failure (also called "strength 
reduction factor"). 

STRENGTH, NOMINAL. The capacity of a structure or 
member to resist the effects of loads, as determined by compu-

equations derived from accepted principles of structural 
mechanics or by field tests or laboratory tests of scaled models, 
allowing for modeling effects and differences between labora- 
tory and field conditions. 

STRENGTH, REQUIRED. Strength of a member, cross sec- 
tion or connection required to resist factored loads or related 
internal moments and forces in such combinations as stipulated 
by these provisions. 

STRENGTH DESIGN. A method of proportioning structural 
members such that the computed forces produced in the mem- 
bers by factored loads do not exceed the member design 
strength [also called "load and resistance factor design" 
(LRFD)]. The term "strength design" is used in the design of 
concrete and masonry structural elements.

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm. 

a. For structural roofing and siding made of formed metal sheets, the total load 
deflection shall not exceed //60. For secondary roof structural members sup- 
porting formed metal roofing, the five load deflection shall not exceed //1 50. 
For secondary wall members supporting formed metal siding, the design 
wind load deflection shall not exceed //90. For roofs, this exception only 
appUes when the metal sheets have no roof covering. 

b. Interior partitions not exceeding 6 feet in height and flexible, folding and 
portable partitions are not governed by the provisions of this section. The 
deflection criterion for interior partitions is based on the horizontal load 
defined in Section 1607.13. 

c. See Section 2403 for glass supports. 

d. For wood structural members having a moisture content of less than 16 per- 
cent at time of installation and used under dry conditions, the deflection 
resulting from L + 0.5D is permitted to be substituted for the deflection 
resulting from L + D. 

e. The above deflections do not ensure against ponding. Roofs that do not have 
sufficient slope or camber to assure adequate drainage shall be investigated 
for ponding. See Section 161 1 for rain and ponding requirements and Sec- 
tion 1503.4 for roof drainage requirements. 

f . The wind load is permitted to be taken as 0.7 times the "component and clad- 
ding" loads for the purpose of determining deflection hmits herein. 

g. For steel structural members, the dead load shall be taten as zero. 

h. For aluminum structural members or aluminum panels used in skylights and 
sloped glazing framing, roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, 
not supporting edge of glass or aluminum sandwich panels, the total load 
deflection shall not exceed Vgp. For aluminum sandwich panels used in roofs 
or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, the total load deflection shall 
not exceed V120. 

i. For cantilever members, / shall be taken as twice the length of the cantilever. 



1604.3.3 Steel. The deflection of steel structural members 
shall not exceed that permitted by AISC 360, AISI-NAS, 
AISI-General, AISI-Truss, ASCE 3, ASCE 8, SJI JG-1.1, 
SJI K-1.1 or SJI LH/DLH-1.1, as applicable. 

1604.3.4 Masonry. The deflection of masonry structural 
members shall not exceed that permitted by ACI 530/ASCE 
5/TMS 402. 

1604.3.5 Aluminum. The deflection of aluminum struc- 
tural members shall not exceed that permitted by AA 
ADMl. 

1604.3.6 Limits. Deflection of structural members over 
span, /, shall not exceed that permitted by Table 1604.3. 



1604.4 Analysis. Load effects on structural members and their 
connections shall be determined by methods of structural anal- 
ysis that take into account equilibrium, general stability, geo- 
metric compatibility and both short- and long-term material 
properties. 

Members that tend to accumulate residual deformations 
under repeated service loads shall have included in their analy- 
sis the added eccentricities expected to occur during their ser- 
vice life. 

Any system or method of construction to be used shaU be 
based on a rational analysis in accordance with well-estabUshed 
principles of mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system 
that provides a complete load path capable of transferring loads 
from their point of origin to the load-resisting elements. 

The total lateral force shall be distributed to the various verti- 
cal elements of the lateral-force-resisting system in proportion 
to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the horizontal 
bracing system or diaphragm. Rigid elements assumed not to 
be a part of the lateral-force-resisting system are permitted to 
be incorporated into buildings provided their effect on the 
action of the system is considered and provided for in the 
design. Except where diaphragms are flexible, or are permitted 
to be analyzed as flexible, provisions shall be made for the 
increased forces induced on resisting elements of the structural 
system resulting from torsion due to eccentricity between the 
center of application of the lateral forces and the center of rigid- 
ity of the lateral-force-resisting system. 

Every structure shall be designed to resist the overturning 
effects caused by the lateral forces specified in this chapter. See 
Section 1609 for wind loads, Section 1610 for lateral soil loads 
and Section 1613 for earthquake loads. 

1604.5 Occupancy category. Buildings shall be assigned an 
occupancy category in accordance with Table 1604.5. 

1604.5.1 Multiple occupancies. Where a structure is occu- 
pied by two or more occupancies not included in the same 
occupancy category, the structure shall be assigned the clas- 
sification of the highest occupancy category corresponding 
to the various occupancies. Where structures have two or 
more portions that are structurally separated, each portion 
shall be separately classified. Where a separated portion of a 
structure provides required access to, required egress from 
or shares life safety components with another portion hav- 
ing a higher occupancy category, both portions shall be 
assigned to the higher occupancy category. 

1604.6 In-situ load tests. The building official is authorized to 
require an engineering analysis or a load test, or both, of any 
construction whenever there is reason to question the safety of 
the construction for the intended occupancy. Engineering anal- 
ysis and load tests shall be conducted in accordance with Sec- 
tion 1713. 

1604.7 Preconstruction load tests. Materials and methods of 
construction that are not capable of being designed by 
approved engineering analysis or that do not comply with the 
applicable material design standards listed in Chapter 35, or 
alternative test procedures in accordance with Section 1711, 
shall be load tested in accordance with Section 1714.

STRUCTURAL DESIGN 



1604.8 Anchorage. 

1604.8.1 General. Anchorage of the roof to walls and col- 
umns, and of walls and columns to foundations, shall be 
provided to resist the upUft and sliding forces that result 
from the application of the prescribed loads. 

1604.8.2 Concrete and masonry walls. Concrete and 
masonry walls shall be anchored to floors, roofs and other 
structural elements that provide lateral support for the wall. 
Such anchorage shall provide a positive direct connection 
capable of resisting the horizontal forces specified in this 
chapter but not less than a minimum strength design hori- 
zontal force of 280 plf (4.10 kN/m) of wall, substituted for 
"£" in the load combinations of Section 1605.2 or 1605.3. 
Walls shall be designed to resist bending between anchors 
where the anchor spacing exceeds 4 feet (1219 mm). 
Required anchors in masonry walls of hollow units or cavity 
walls shall be embedded in a reinforced grouted structural 
element of the wall. See Sections 1609 for wind design 
requirements and see Section 1613 for earthquake design 
requirements. 

1604.8.3 Decks. Where supported by attachment to an exterior 
wall, decks shall be positively anchored to the primary struc- 
ture and designed for both vertical and lateral loads as applica- 
ble. Such attachment shall not be accompUshed by the use of 
toenails or nails subject to withdrawal. Where positive connec- 
tion to the primary building structure cannot be verified during 
inspection, decks shall be self-supporting. For decks with can- 
tilevered framing members, connections to exterior walls or 
other framing members shall be designed and constructed to 
resist uplift resulting from the fuU live load specified in Table 
1607. 1 acting on the cantilevered portion of the deck. 

1604.9 Counteracting structural actions. Structural mem- 
bers, systems, components and cladding shall be designed to 
resist forces due to earthquake and wind, with consideration of 
overturning, sliding, and uplift. Continuous load paths shall be 
provided for transmitting these forces to the foundation. Where 
shding is used to isolate the elements, the effects of friction 
between sliding elements shall be included as a force. 

1604.10 Wind and seismic detailing. Lateral-force-resisting 
systems shall meet seismic detaiUng requirements and limita- 
tions prescribed in this code and ASCE 7, excluding Chapter 
14 and Appendix 11 A, even when wind code prescribed load 
effects are greater than seismic load effects. 

SECTION 1605 
LOAD COMBINATIONS 

1605.1 General. Buildings and other structures and portions 
thereof shall be designed to resist the load combinations speci- 
fied in Section 1605.2 or 1605.3 and Chapters 18 through 23, 
and the special seismic load combinations of Section 1605.4 
where required by Section 12.3.3.3 or 12.10.2.1 of ASCE 7. 
Applicable loads shall be considered, including both earth- 
quake and wind, in accordance with the specified load combi- 
nations. Each load combination shall also be investigated with 
one or more of the variable loads set to zero. 

1605.2 Load combinations using strength design or load 
and resistance factor design. 



1605.2.1 Basic load combinations. Where strength design 
or load and resistance factor design is used, structures and 
portions thereof shall resist the most critical effects from the 
following combinations of factored loads: 



IA(D + F) 

l.2(D + F+T) + 1.6(L + H) + 
0.5(L,orSor/?)

(Equation 16-6) 

(Equation 16-7) 

/i = 1 for floors in places of public assembly, for live loads 
in excess of 100 pounds per square foot (4.79 kN/m^), 
and for parking garage live load, and 

= 0.5 for other live loads. 

/2 = 0.7 for roof configurations (such as saw tooth) that do 
not shed snow off the structure, and 

= 0.2 for other roof configurations. 

Exception: Where other factored load combinations are 
specifically required by the provisions of this code, such 
combinations shall take precedence. 

1605.2.2 Other loads. Where F^ is to be considered in the 
design, the load combinations of Section 2.3.3 of ASCE 7 
shall be used. 

1605.3 Load combinations using allowable stress design. 

1605.3.1 Basic load combinations. Where allowable stress 
design (working sttess design), as permitted by this code, is 
used, structures and portions thereof shall resist the most 
critical effects resulting from the following combinations of 



(Equation 16-8)

Exceptions: 

1 . Crane hook loads need not be combined with roof 
live load or with more than three-fourths of the 
snow load or. one-half of the wind load. 

2. Flat roof snow loads of 30 psf ( 1 .44 kN/m^) or less 
need not be combined with seismic loads. Where 



282 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE® 



STRUCTURAL DESIGN 



flat roof snow loads exceed 30 psf (1.44 kN/m^), 
20 percent shall be combined with seismic loads. 

1605.3.1.1 Stress increases. Increases in allowable 
stresses specified in the appropriate material chapter or 
the referenced standards shall not be used with the load 
combinations of Section 1605.3. 1 , except that a duration 
of load increase shall be permitted in accordance with 
Chapter 23. 

1605.3.1.2 Other loads. Where F^ is to be considered in 
design, the load combinations of Section 2.4.2 of ASCE 
7 shall be used. 

1605.3.2 Alternative basic load combinations. In lieu of the 
basic load combinations specified in Section 1605.3.1, struc- 
tures and portions thereof shall be permitted to be designed for 
the most critical effects resulting from the following combina- 
tions. When using these alternative basic load combinations 
that include wind or seismic loads, allowable stresses are per- 
mitted to be increased or load combinations reduced where 
permitted by the material chapter of this code or the referenced 
standards. For load combinations that include the counteract- 
ing effects of dead and wind loads, only two-thirds of the mini- 
mum dead load likely to be in place during a design wind event 
shall be used. Where wind loads are calculated in accordance 
with Chapter 6 of ASCE 7, the coefficient (o in the following 
equations shall be taken as 1 .3. For other wind loads, (o shall be 
taken as 1. When using these alternative load combinations to 
evaluate sliding, overturning and soil bearing at the soil-struc- 
ture interface, the reduction of foundation overturning from 
Section 12. 13.4 in ASCE 7 shall not be used. When using these 
alternative basic load combinations for proportioning founda- 
tions for loadings, which include seismic loads, the vertical 
seismic load effect, E^, in Equation 12.4-4 of ASCE 7 is permit- 
ted to be taken equal to zero.

2. Flat roof snow loads of 30 psf (1.44 kN/m^) or less 
need not be combined with seismic loads. Where flat 
roof snow loads exceed 30 psf (1 .44 kN/m^), 20 per- 
cent shall be combined with seismic loads, 

1605.3.2.1 Other loads. Where F,HotT are to be con- 
sidered in the design, each apphcable load shall be added 
to the combinations specified in Section 1605.3.2. 

1605.4 Special seismic load combinations. For both allow- 
able stress design and strength design methods where specifi- 
cally required by Section 1605. 1 or by Chapters 18 through 23, 



elements and components shall be designed to resist the forces 
calculated using Equation 16-22 when the effects of the seis- 
mic ground motion are additive to gravity forces and those cal- 
culated using Equation 16-23 when the effects of the seismic 
ground motion counteract gravity forces.

1605.5 Heliports and helistops. Heliport and helistop landing 
areas shall be designed for the following loads, combined in 
accordance with Section 1605: 

1 . Dead load, D, plus the gross weight of the helicopter, D,,, 
plus snow load, S. 

2. Dead load, D, plus two single concentrated impact loads, 
L, approximately 8 feet (2438 mm) apart applied any- 
where on the landing area (representing the helicopter's 
two main landing gear, whether skid type or wheeled 
type), having a magnitude of 0.75 times the gross weight 
of the helicopter. Both loads acting together total 
one-and one half times the gross weight of the helicopter. 

3. Dead load, D, plus a uniform live load, L, of 100 psf (4.79 
kN/m^). 

Exception: Landing areas designed for helicopters 
with gross weights not exceeding 3,000 pounds 
(13.34 kN) in accordance with Items 1 and 2 shall be 
permitted to be designed using a 40 psf (1.92 kN/m^) 
uniform live load in Item 3, provided the landing area 
is identified with a 3,000 pound (13.34 kN) weight 
limitation. This 40 psf ( 1 .92 kN/m^) uniform live load 
shall not be reduced. The landing area weight limita- 
tion shall be indicated by the numeral "3" (kips) 
located in the bottom right comer of the landing area 
as viewed from the primary approach path. The land- 
ing area weight limitation shall be a minimum of 5 
feet (1524 mm) in height. 



SECTION 1606 
DEAD LOADS 

1606.1 General. Dead loads are those loads defined in Section 
1602.1. Dead loads shall be considered permanent loads. 

1606.2 Design dead load. For purposes of design, the actual 
weights of materials of construction and fixed service equip- 
ment shall be used. In the absence of definite information, val- 
ues used shall be subject to the approval of the building official.

SECTION 1607 
LIVE LOADS 

1607.1 GeneraL Live loads are those loads defined in Section 
1602.1. 

1607.2 Loads not specified. For occupancies or uses not des- 
ignated in Table 1607.1, the live load shall be determined in 
accordance with a method approved by the building official. 

1607.3 Uniform live loads. The live loads used in the design of 
buildings and other structures shall be the maximum loads 
expected by the intended use or occupancy but shall in no case 
be less than the minimum uniformly distributed unit loads 
required by Table 1 607 . 1 . 

1607.4 Concentrated loads. Floors and other similar surfaces 
shall be designed to support the uniformly distributed live 
loads prescribed in Section 1607.3 or the concentrated load, in 
pounds (kilonewtons), given in Table 1607.1, whichever pro- 
duces the greater load effects. Unless otherwise specified, the 
indicated concentration shall be assumed to be uniformly dis- 
tributed over an area 2.5 feet by 2.5 feet [6.25 square feet (0.58 
m^)] and shall be located so as to produce the maximum load 
effects in the structural members. 

1607.5 Partition loads. In office buildings and in other build- 
ings where partition locations are subject to change, provisions 
for partition weight shall be made, whether or not partitions are 
shown on the construction documents, unless the specified live 
load exceeds 80 psf (3.83 kN/m^). The partition load shall not 
be less than a uniformly distributed live load of 15 psf (0.74 
kN/m2). 

1607.6 Truck and bus garages. Minimum live loads for 
garages having trucks or buses shall be as specified in Table 
1607.6, but shall not be less than,50 psf (2.40 kN/m^), unless 
other loads are specifically justified and approved by the build- 
ing official. Actual loads shall be used where they are greater 
than the loads specified in the table.

lowing the letter classification indicate the gross weight in tons of the stan- 
dard truck and the year the loadings were instituted. 

b. See Section 1607.6.1 for the loading of multiple spans. 

1607.6.1 Truck and bus garage live load application. The 

concentrated load and uniform load shall be uniformly dis- 
tributed over a 10-foot (3048 mm) width on a line normal to 
the centerline of the lane placed within a 12-foot- wide 
(3658 mm) lane. The loads shall be placed within their indi- 



vidual lanes so as to produce the maximum stress in each 
structural member. Single spans shall be designed for the 
uniform load in Table 1607.6 and one simultaneous concen- 
trated load positioned to produce the maximum effect. Mul- 
tiple spans shall be designed for the uniform load in Table 
1607.6 on the spans and two simultaneous concentrated 
loads in two spans positioned to produce the maximum neg- 
ative moment effect. Multiple span design loads, for other 
effects, shall be the same as for single spans. 

1607.7 Loads on handrails, guards, grab bars and vehicle 
barriers. Handrails, guards, grab bars as designed in ICC 
Al 17.1 and vehicle barriers shall be designed and constructed 
to the structural loading conditions set forth in this section. 

1607.7.1 Handrails and guards. Handrail assemblies and 
guards shall be designed to resist a load of 50 plf (0.73 
kN/m) applied in any direction at the top and to transfer this 
load through the supports to the structure. Glass handrail 
assemblies and guards shall also comply with Section 2407. 

Exceptions: 

1 . For one- and two-family dwellings, only the single 
concentrated load required by Section 1607.7.1.1 
shall be applied. 

2. In Group 1-3, F, H and S occupancies, for areas that 
are not accessible to the general public and that 
have an occupant load less than 50, the minimum 
load shall be 20 pounds per foot (0.29 kN/m). 

1607.7.1.1 Concentrated load. Handrail assemblies 
and guards shall be able to resist a single concentrated 
load of 200 pounds (0.89 kN), applied in any direction at 
any point along the top, and have attachment devices and 
supporting structure to transfer this loading to appropri- 
ate structural elements of the building. This load need not 
be assumed to act concurrently with the loads specified 
in the preceding paragraph. 

1607.7.1.2 Components. Intermediate rails (all those 
except the handrail), balusters and panel fillers shall be 
designed to withstand a horizontally applied normal load 
of 50 pounds (0.22 kN) on an area equal to 1 square foot 
(0.093m2), including openings and space between rails. 
Reactions due to this loading are not required to be 
superimposed with those of Section 1607.7.1 or 
1607.7.1.1. 

1607.7.1.3 Stress increase. Where handrails and guards 
are designed in accordance with the provisions for allow- 
able stress design (working stress design) exclusively for 
the loads specified in Section 1607.7.1, the allowable 
stress for the members and their attachments are permit- 
ted to be increased by one-third. 

1607.7.2 Grab bars, shower seats and dressing room 
bench seats. Grab bars, shower seats and dressing room 
bench seat systems shall be designed to resist a single con- 
centrated load of 250 pounds (1.11 kN) applied in any direc- 
tion at any point.

STRUCTURAL DESIGN 



1607.10 Distribution of floor loads. Where uniform floor live 
loads are involved in the design of structural members arranged 
so as to create continuity, the minimum applied loads shall be 
the full dead loads on all spans in combination with the floor 
live loads on spans selected to produce the greatest effect at 
each location under consideration. It shall be permitted to 
reduce floor live loads in accordance with Section 1607.9. 

1607.11 Roof loads. The structural supports of roofs and mar- 
quees shall be designed to resist wind and, where applicable, 
snow and earthquake loads, in addition to the dead load of con- 
struction and the appropriate live loads as prescribed in this 
section, or as set forth in Table 1607. 1 . The live loads acting on 
a sloping surface shall be assumed to act vertically on the hori- 
zontal projection of that surface. 

1607.11.1 Distribution of roof loads. Where uniform roof 
live loads are reduced to less than 20 psf (0.96 kN/m^) in 
accordance with Section 1 607 .11.2.1 and are involved in the 
design of structural members arranged so as to create conti- 
nuity, the minimum applied loads shall be the full dead loads 
on all spans in combination with the roof live loads on adja- 
cent spans or on alternate spans, whichever produces the 
greatest effect. See Section 1607.11.2 for minimum roof 
live loads and Section 7.5 of ASCE 7 for partial snow load- 
ing. 

1607.11.2 Reduction in roof live loads. The minimum uni- 
formly distributed roof Uve loads, L„, in Table 1607. 1 are per- 
mitted to be reduced according to the following provisions. 

1607.11.2.1 Flat, pitched and curved roofs. Ordinary 
flat, pitched and curved roofs are permitted to be 
designed for a reduced roof live load as specified in the 
following equation or other controlling combinations of 
loads in Section 1605, whichever produces the greater 
load. In structures where special scaffolding is used as a 
work surface for workers and materials during mainte- 
nance and repair operations, a lower roof load than speci- 
fied in the following equation shall not be used unless 
approved by the building official. Greenhouses shall be 
designed for a minimum roof live load of 12 psf (0.58 
kN/m2).

landscaped, the uniform design live load in the land- 
scaped area shall be 20 psf (0.958 kN/m^). The weight of 
the landscaping materials shall be considered as dead 
load and shall be computed on the basis of saturation of 
the soil. 

1607.11.2.4 Awnings and canopies. Awnings and cano- 
pies shall be designed for uniform live loads as required I 
in Table 1607. 1 as well as for snow loads and wind loads | 
as specified in Sections 1608 and 1609. 

1607.12 Crane loads. The crane live load shall be the rated 
capacity of the crane. Design loads for the runway beams, 
including connections and support brackets, of moving bridge 
cranes and monorail cranes shall include the maximum wheel 
loads of the crane and the vertical impact, lateral and longitudi- 
nal forces induced by the moving crane. 

1607.12.1 Maximum wheel load. The maximum wheel 
loads shall be the wheel loads produced by the weight of the 
bridge, as applicable, plus the sum of the rated capacity and 
the weight of the trolley with the trolley positioned on its 
runway at the location where the resulting load effect is 
maximum. 

1607.12.2 Vertical impact force. The maximum wheel 
loads of the crane shall be increased by the percentages 
shown below to determine the induced vertical impact or 
vibration force:

1607.12.3 Lateral force. The lateral force on crane runway 
beams with electrically powered trolleys shall be calculated 
as 20 percent of the sum of the rated capacity of the crane 
and the weight of the hoist and trolley. The lateral force shall 
be assumed to act horizontally at the traction surface of a 
runway beam, in either direction perpendicular to the beam, 
and shall be distributed according to the lateral stiffness of 
the runway beam and supporting structure. 

1607.12.4 Longitudinal force. The longitudinal force on 
crane runway beams, except for bridge cranes with 
hand-geared bridges, shall be calculated as 10 percent of the 
maximum wheel loads of the crane. The longitudinal force 
shall be assumed to act horizontally at the traction surface of 
a runway beam, in either direction parallel to the beam. 

1607.13 Interior walls and partitions. Interior walls and par- 
titions that exceed 6 feet (1829 mm) in height, including their 
finish materials, shall have adequate strength to resist the loads 
to which they are subjected but not less than a horizontal load of 

5psf(0.240kN/m2). 

Exception: Fabric partitions complying with Section 
1607. 13. 1 shall not be required to resist the minimum hori- 
zontal load of 5 psf (0.24 kN/m^). 

1607.13.1 Fabric partitions. Fabric partitions that exceed 6 
feet (1829 mm) in height, including their finish materials, 
shall have adequate strength to resist the following load con- 
ditions: 

1. A horizontal distributed load of 5 psf (0.24 kN/m^) 
applied to the partition framing. The total area used to 
determine the distributed load shall be the area of the 
fabric face between the framing members to which 
the fabric is attached. The total distributed load shall 
be uniformly applied to such framing members in 
proportion to the length of each member. 



2. A concentrated load of 40 pounds (0.176 kN) applied 
to an 8-inch diameter (203 mm) area [50.3 square 
inches (32 452 mm^)] of the fabric face at a height of 
54 inches (1372 mm) above the floor. 



SECTION 1608 
SNOW LOADS 

1608.1 General. Design snow loads shall be determined in 
accordance with Chapter 7 of ASCE 7, but the design roof load 
shall not be less than that determined by Section 1607. 

1608.2 Ground snow loads. The ground snow loads to be used 
in determining the design snow loads for roofs shall be deter- 
mined in accordance with ASCE 7 or Figure 1608.2 for the 
contiguous United States and Table 1608.2 for Alaska. 
Site-specific case studies shall be made in areas designated 
"CS" in Figure 1608.2. Ground snow loads for sites at eleva- 
tions above the limits indicated in Figure 1608.2 and for all 
sites within the CS areas shall be approved. Ground snow load 
determination for such sites shall be based on an extreme value 
statistical analysis of data available in the vicinity of the site 
using a value with a 2-percent annual probabiUty of being

where the basic wind speed is 120 mph (53 m/s) or greater; or 
Hawaii. 

1609.3 Basic wind speed. The basic wind speed, in mph, for 
the determination of the wind loads shall be determined by Fig- 
ure 1609. Basic wind speed for the special wind regions indi- 
cated, near mountainous terrain and near gorges shall be in 
accordance with local jurisdiction requirements. Basic wind 
speeds determined by die local jurisdiction shall be in accor- 
dance with Section 6.5.4 of ASCE 7. 

In nonhurricane-prone regions, when the basic wind speed is 
estimated from regional climatic data, the basic wind speed 
shall be not less than the wind speed associated with an annual 
probability of 0.02 (50-year mean recurrence interval), and the 
estimate shall be adjusted for equivalence to a 3-second gust 
wind speed at 33 feet (10 m) above ground in Exposure Cate- 
gory C. The data analysis shall be performed in accordance 
with Section 6.5.4.2 of ASCE 7. 

1609.3.1 Wind speed conversion. When required, the 
3-second gust basic wind speeds of Figure 1609 shall be 
converted to fastest-mile wind speeds, V^, using Table

1609.4 Exposure category. For each wind direction consid- 
ered, an exposure category that adequately reflects the charac- 
teristics of ground surface irregularities shall be determined for 
the site at which the building or structure is to be constructed. 
Account shall be taken of variations in ground surface rough- 
ness that arise from natural topography and vegetation as well 
as from constructed features.

wind direction at which the wind loads are to be evaluated, 
the exposure of the building or structure shall be determined 
for the two upwind sectors extending 45 degrees (0.79 rad) 
either side of the selected wind direction. The exposures in 
these two sectors shall be determined in accordance with 
Sections 1609.4.2 and 1609.4.3 and the exposure resulting 
in the highest wind loads shall be used to represent winds 
from that direction. 



1609.4.2 Surface roughness categories. A ground surface 
roughness within each 45-degree (0.79 rad) sector shall be 
determined for a distance upwind of the site as defined in 
Section 1609.4.3 from the categories defined below, for the 
purpose of assigning an exposure category as defined in 
Section 1609.4.3. 

Surface Roughness B. Urban and suburban areas, 
wooded areas or other terrain with numerous closely 
spaced obstructions having the size of single-family 
dwellings or larger.

(9144 mm). This category includes flat open country, 
grasslands, and all water surfaces in hurricane-prone 
regions. 

Surface Roughness D. Flat, unobstructed areas and 
water surfaces outside hurricane-prone regions. This cat- 
egory includes smooth mud flats, salt flats and unbroken 
ice. 

1609.4.3 Exposure categories. An exposure category shall

Exposure B. Exposure B shall apply where the ground 
surface roughness condition, as defined by Surface 
Roughness B, prevails in the upwind direction for a dis- 
tance of at least 2,600 feet (792 m) or 20 times the height 
of the building, whichever is greater. 

Exception: For buildings whose mean roof height is 
less than or equal to 30 feet (9144 mm), tiie upwind dis- 
tance is permitted to be reduced to 1,500 feet (457 m). 

Exposure C. Exposure C shall apply for all cases where 
Exposures B or D do not apply. 

Exposure D. Exposure D shall apply where the ground 
surface roughness, as defined by Surface Roughness D, 
prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of at least 
5,000 feet (1524 m) or 20 times the height of the build- 
ing, whichever is greater. Exposure D shall extend inland 
from the shoreline for a distance of 600 feet (183 m) or 20 
times the height of the building, whichever is greater.

ing site-specific evaluation. If the site corresponds 
to any of these categories, classify the site as Site 
Class F and conduct a site-specific evaluation. 

2. Check for the existence of a total thickness of soft 
clay &gt; 10 feet (3048 mm) where a soft clay layer is 
defined by: 5„ &lt; 500 psf (24 kPa), w &gt; 40 percent 
and PI &gt; 20. If these criteria are satisfied, classify 
the site as Site Class E.

DISCUSSION 

The acceleration values contoured on this map are for the random horizontal 
conqnnent of acceleration For design purposes, the reference site condition 
fin- ^ map is to be talxn as Site Class B. 

The two areas shown as zone boundaries are the ^mjection to the earth' s 
surface ofhorizontal rupture planes at 9 km depth Spectral accelerations 
are constant within the bouniiries of the zones. The number on the boundary 
and inside the zone is the median spectral response acceleration times 1 .5. 

Leyendecker, fiankel, and Rukstales (2001 , 2004) have prepared a CD-ROM 
that contains software to allow determination of Site Class B map values by 
latitude-longitude. The software on the CD contains site coefficients that 
allow the user to adjust map values for different Site Classes. Additional 
maps at different scales are also included on the CD. The CD was prepoied 
using the same data as diat used to prepare the Maximum Considered Earthqualoe 
Ground Motion maps. 

The National Seismic Hazard Mapfnng Project Web Site, 
httpc//eqhazmaps. usgs.gov, contains electronic versions of this map 
and others. Documentation, ^dded values, and Arc/INPO coverages used 
to make the maps are also available.

simulate the applicable loading conditions specified in Chapter 
16 as necessary to address the concerns regarding structural 
stability of the building, structure or portion thereof. 

1713.3.1 Load test procedure specified. Where a standard 
listed in Chapter 35 contains an applicable load test proce- 
dure and acceptance criteria, the test procedure and accep- 
tance criteria in the standard shall apply. In the absence of 
specific load factors or acceptance criteria, the load factors 
and acceptance criteria in Section 1713.3.2 shall apply. 

1713.3.2 Load test procedure not specified. In the absence 
of applicable load test procedures contained within a stan- 
dard referenced by this code or acceptance criteria for a spe- 
cific material or method of construction, such existing 
structure shall be subjected to a test procedure developed by 
a registered design professional that simulates applicable 
loading and deformation conditions. For components that 
are not a part of the seismic-load-resisting system, the test 
load shall be equal to two times the unfactored design loads. 
The test load shall be left in place for a period of 24 hours. 
The structure shall be considered to have successfully met

load test criteria established in this section. 

1714.2 Load test procedures specified. Where specific load 
test procedures, load factors and acceptance criteria are 



included in the applicable design standards listed in Chapter 
35, such test procedures, load factors and acceptance criteria 
shall apply. In the absence of specific test procedures, load fac- 
tors or acceptance criteria, the corresponding provisions in 
Section 1714.3 shall apply. 

1714.3 Load test procedures not specified. Where load test 
procedures are not specified in the applicable design standards 
listed in Chapter 35, the load-bearing and deformation capacity 
of structural components and assemblies shall be determined 
on the basis of a test procedure developed by a registered 
design professional that simulates applicable loading and 
deformation conditions. For components and assemblies that 
are not a part of the seismic-load-resisting system, the test shall 
be as specified in Section 1714.3.1. Load tests shall simulate 
the applicable loading conditions specified in Chapter 16. 

1714.3.1 Test procedure. The test assembly shall be sub- 
jected to an increasing superimposed load equal to not less

assembly shall be considered to have successfully met the 
test requirements if the assembly recovers not less than 75 
percent of the maximum deflection within 24 hours after the 
removal of the test load. The test assembly shall then be 
reloaded and subjected to an increasing superimposed load 
until either structural failure occurs or the superimposed 
load is equal to two and one-half times the load at which the 
deflection limitations specified in Section 1714.3.2 were 
reached, or the load is equal to two and one-half times the 
superimposed design load. In the case of structural compo- 
nents and assemblies for which deflection limitations are 
not specified in Section 1714.3.2, the test specimen shall be 
subjected to an increasing superimposed load until struc- 
tural failure occurs or the load is equal to two and one-half 
times the desired superimposed design load. The allowable 
superimposed design load shall be taken as the lesser of: 

1. The load at the deflection limitation given in Section 
1714.3.2. 

2. The failure load divided by 2.5. 

3. The maximum load applied divided by 2.5. 

1714.3.2 Deflection. The deflection of structural members 
under the design load shall not exceed the limitations in Sec- 
tion 1604.3.

EXCAVATION, GRADING AND FILL 

1803.1 Excavations near footings or foundations. Excava- 
tions for any purpose shall not remove lateral support from any 
footing or foundation without first underpinning or protecting 
the footing or foundation against settlement or lateral transla- 
tion. 

1803.2 Placement of backfill. The excavation outside the 
foundation shall be backfilled with soil that is free of organic 
material, construction debris, cobbles and boulders or a con- 
trolled low-strength material (CLSM). The backfill shall be 
placed in lifts and compacted, in a manner that does not damage 
the foundation or the waterproofing or dampproofing material. 

Exception: Controlled low-strength material need not be 
compacted. 

1803.3 Site grading. The ground inmiediately adjacent to the 
foundation shall be sloped away from the building at a slope of 
not less than one unit vertical in 20 units horizontal (5-percent 
slope) for a minimum distance of 10 feet (3048 mm) measured 
perpendicular to the face of the wall. If physical obstructions or 
lot Unes prohibit 10 feet (3048 mm) of horizontal distance, a 
5-percent slope shall be provided to an approved alternative 
method of (Mverting water away firom the foundation. Swales 
used for this purpose shall be sloped a minimum of 2 percent 
where located within 10 feet (3048 mm) of the building foun- 
dation. Impervious surfaces within 10 feet (3048 mm) of the 
building foundation shall be sloped a minimum of 2 percent 
away from the building. 

Exception: Where climatic or soil conditions warrant, the 
slope of the ground away from the building foundation is 
permitted to be reduced to not less than one unit vertical in 
48 units horizontal (2-percent slope). 

The procedure used to establish the final ground level adja- 
cent to the foundation shall account for additional settlement of 
the backfill. 

1803.4 Grading and fill in flood hazard areas. In fiood haz- 
ard areas estabhshed in Section 1612.3, grading and/or fill shall 
not be approved: 

1 . Unless such fill is placed, compacted and sloped to mini- 
mize shifting, slumping and erosion during the rise and 
fall of flood water and, as applicable, wave action. 

2. In floodways, unless it has been demonstrated through 
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a regis- 
tered design professional in accordance with standard

engineering practice that the proposed grading or fill, or 
both, will not result in any increase in flood levels during 
the occurrence of the design flood. 

3. In flood hazard areas subject to high-velocity wave 
action, unless such fill is conducted and/or placed to 
avoid diversion of water and waves toward any building 
or structure. 

4. Where design flood elevations are specified but 
floodways have not been designated, unless it has been 
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed 
flood hazard area encroachment, when combined with 
all other existing and anticipated flood hazard area 
encroachment, will not increase the design flood eleva- 
tion more than 1 foot (305 mm) at any point. 

1803.5 Compacted fill material. Where footings will bear on 
compacted fill material, the compacted fill shall comply with 
the provisions of an approved report, which shall contain the 
following:

in Table 1804.2 shall be used with the allowable stress design 
load combinations specified in Section 1605.3. 

1804.2 Presumptive load-bearing values. The maximum allow- 
able foundation pressure, lateral pressure or lateral shding-resis- 
tance values for supporting soils near the surface shall not exceed 
the values specified in Table 1804.2 unless data to substantiate 
the use of a higher value are submitted and approved. 

Presumptive load-bearing values shall apply to materials

not be assumed to have a presumptive load-bearing capacity 
unless data to substantiate the use of such a value are submitted. 

Exception: A presumptive load-bearing capacity is permit- 
ted to be used where the building official deems the 
load-bearing capacity of mud, organic silt or unprepared fill 
is adequate for the support of lightweight and temporary 
structures. 

1804.3 Lateral sliding resistance. The resistance of structural 
walls to lateral sliding shall be calculated by combining the val- 
ues derived from the lateral bearing and the lateral sliding resis- 
tance shown in Table 1804.2 unless data to substantiate the use 
of higher values are submitted for approval. 

For clay, sandy clay, silty clay and clayey silt, in no case shall 
the lateral sliding resistance exceed one-half the dead load.

Footings shall not bear on frozen soil unless such frozen 
condition is of a permanent character. 

1805.2.2 Isolated footings. Footings on granular soil shall 
be so located that the line drawn between the lower edges of 
adjoining footings shall not have a slope steeper than 30 
degrees (0.52 rad) with the horizontal, unless the material 
supporting the higher footing is braced or retained or other- 
wise laterally supported in an approved manner or a greater 
slope has been properly established by engineering analy- 
sis. 

1805.2.3 Shifting or moving soils. Where it is known that 
the shallow subsoils are of a shifting or moving character, 



footings shall be carried to a sufficient depth to ensure stabil- 
ity-

age, erosion and shallow failures. Except as provided for in 
Section 1805.3.5 and Figure 1805.3.1, the following criteria 
will be assumed to provide this protection. Where the exist- 
ing slope is steeper than one unit vertical in one unit hori- 
zontal (100-percent slope), the toe of the slope shall be 
assumed to be at the intersection of a horizontal plane drawn 
from the top of the foundation and a plane drawn tangent to 
the slope at an angle of 45 degrees (0.79 rad) to the horizon- 
tal. Where a retaining wall is constructed at the toe of the 
slope, the height of the slope shall be measured from the top 
of the wall to the top of the slope. 

1805.3.2 Footing setback from descending slope sur- 
face. Footings on or adjacent to slope surfaces shall be 
founded in firm material with an embedment and set back 
from the slope surface sufficient to provide vertical and lat- 
eral support for the footing without detrimental settlement. 
Except as provided for in Section 1805.3.5 and Figure 
1805.3.1, the following setback is deemed adequate to 
meet the criteria. Where the slope is steeper than 1 unit ver- 
tical in 1 unit horizoiital (100-percent slope), the required 
setback shall be measured from an imaginary plane 45 
degrees (0.79 rad) to the horizontal, projected upward 
from the toe of the slope. 

1805.3.3 Pools. The setback between pools regulated by 
this code and slopes shall be equal to one-half the building 
footing setback distance required by this section. That por- 
tion of the pool wall within a horizontal distance of 7 feet

any exterior foundation shall extend above the elevation of 
the street gutter at point of discharge or the inlet of an 
approved drainage device a minimum of 12 inches (305 
mm) plus 2 percent. Alternate elevations are permitted sub- 
ject to the approval of the building official, provided it can 
be demonstrated that required drainage to the point of dis- 
charge and away from the structure is provided at all loca- 
tions on the site. 

1805.3.5 Alternate setback and clearance. Alternate set- 
backs and clearances are permitted, subject to the approval of 
the building official. The building official is permitted to 
require an investigation and recommendation of a registered 
design professional to demonstrate that the intent of this sec-

fied in Sections 1607.9 and 1607.1 1, are permitted to be 
used in the design of footings. 

1805.4.1.2 Vibratory loads. Where machinery opera- 
tions or other vibrations are transmitted through the 
foundation, consideration shall be given in the footing 
design to prevent detrimental disturbances of the soil.

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 



1805.5.1.2 Thickness based on soil loads, unbalanced 
backfill height and wall height. The thickness of foun- 
dation walls shall comply with the requirements of Table 
1805.5(5) for concrete walls, Table 1805.5(1) for plain 
masonry walls or Table 1805.5(2), 1805.5(3) or 
1805.5(4) for masonry walls with reinforcement. When 
using the tables, masonry shall be laid in running bond 
and the mortar shall be Type M or S. 

Unbalanced backfill height is the difference in height 
between the exterior finish ground level and the lower of 
the top of the concrete footing that supports the founda- 
tion wall or the interior finish ground level. Where an 
interior concrete slab on grade is provided and is in con- 
tact with the interior surface of the foundation wall, the 
unbalanced backfill height is permitted to be measured 
from the exterior finish ground level to the top of the inte- 
rior concrete slab. 

1805.5.1.3 Rubble stone. Foundation walls of rough or 
random rubble stone shall not be less than 16 inches (406 
mm) thick. Rubble stone shall not be used for foundations 
for structures in Seismic Design Category C, D, E or F. 

1805.5.2 Foundation wall materials. Concrete foundation 
walls constructed in accordance with Table 1805.5(5) shall 
comply with Section 1805.5.2.1. Masonry foundation walls 
constructed in accordance with Table 1805.5(1), 1805.5(2), 
1805.5(3) or 1805.5(4) shall comply with Section 
1805.5.2.2. 

1805.5.2.1 Concrete foundation walls. Concrete foun- 
dation walls shall comply with the following: 

1. The size and spacing of vertical reinforcement 
shown in Table 1805.5(5) is based on the use of 
reinforcement with a minimum yield strength of 
60,000 psi (414 MPa). Vertical reinforcement with 
a minimum yield strength of 40,000 psi (276 MPa) 
or 50,000 psi (345 MPa) is permitted, provided the 
same size bar is used and the spacing shown in the 
table is reduced by multiplying the spacing by 0.67 
or 0.83, respectively. 

2. Vertical reinforcement, when required, shall be 
placed nearest the inside face of the wall a dis- 
tance, d, from the outside face (soil side) of the 
wall. The distance, d, is equal to the wall thickness, 
t, minus 1 .25 inches (32 mm) plus one-half the bar 
diameter, dj,[d = t-{\. 25 + d,/!)]. The reinforce- 
ment shall be placed within a tolerance of ± ^/g inch 
(9.5 mm) where d is less than or equal to 8 inches 
(203 mm) or ± V2 inch (2.7 mm) where d is greater 
than 8 inches (203 mm). 

3. In lieu of the reinforcement shown in Table 
1805.5(5), smaller reinforcing bar sizes with 
closer spacings that provide an equivalent 
cross-sectional area of reinforcement per unit 
length of wall are permitted. 

4. Concrete cover for reinforcement measured from 
the inside face of the wall shall not be less than V4 
inch (19.1 mm). Concrete cover for reinforcement 
measured from the outside face of the wall shall 



not be less than 1 .5 inches (38 mm) for No. 5 bars 
and smaller and not less than 2 inches (51 mm) for 
larger bars. 

5. Concrete shall have a specified compressive 
strength,/,', of not less than 2,500 psi (17.2 MPa) 
at 28 days. 

6. The unfactored axial load per linear foot of wall 
shall not exceed 1.2 tf^', where t is the specified 
wall thickness in inches. 

1805.5.2.2 Masonry foundation walls. Masonry foun- 
dation walls shall comply with the following: 

1. Vertical reinforcement shall have a minimum 
yield strength of 60,000 psi (414 MPa). 

2. The specified location of the reinforcement shall 
equal or exceed the effective depth distance, d,

SECTION 1808 
PIER AND PILE FOUNDATIONS 

1808.1 Definitions. The following words and terms shall, for 
the purposes of this section, have the meanings shown herein. 

FLEXURAL LENGTH. Flexural length is the length of the 
pile from the first point of zero lateral deflection to the under- 
side of the pile cap or grade beam. 

MICROPILES. Micropiles are 12-inch-diameter (305 mm) 
or less bored, grouted-in-place piles incorporating steel pipe 
(casing) and/or steel reinforcement. 

PIER FOUNDATIONS. Pier foundations consist of isolated 
masonry or cast-in-place concrete structural elements extend- 
ing into firm materials. Piers are relatively short in comparison 
to their width, with lengths less than or equal to 12 times the 
least horizontal dimension of the pier. Piers derive their 
load-carrying capacity through skin friction, through end bear- 
ing, or a combination of both. 

Belled piers. Belled piers are cast-in-place concrete piers 
constructed with a base that is larger than the diameter of the 
remainder of the pier. The belled base is designed to 
increase the load-bearing area of the pier in end bearing. 

PILE FOUNDATIONS. Pile foundations consist of concrete, 
wood or steel structural elements either driven into the ground 
or cast in place. Piles are relatively slender in comparison to 
their length, with lengths exceeding 12 times the least horizon- 
tal dimension. Piles derive their load-carrying capacity through 
skin friction, end bearing or a combination of both. 

Angered uncased piles. Angered uncased piles are con- 
structed by depositing concrete into an uncased augered 
hole, either during or after the withdrawal of the auger. 



358 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE® 



SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 



Caisson piles. Caisson piles are cast-in-place concrete piles 
extending into bedrock. The upper portion of a caisson pile 
consists of a cased pile that extends to the bedrock. The 
lower portion of the caisson pile consists of an uncased 
socket drilled into the bedrock. 

Concrete-filled steel pipe and tube piles. Concrete-filled 
steel pipe and tube piles are constructed by driving a steel 
pipe or tube section into the soil and filling the pipe or tube 
section with concrete. The steel pipe or tube section is left in 
place during and after the deposition of the concrete. 

Driven uncased piles. Driven uncased piles are constructed 
by driving a steel shell into the soil to shore an unexcavated 
hole that is later filled with concrete. The steel casing is 
lifted out of the hole during the deposition of the concrete. 

Enlarged base piles. Enlarged base piles are cast-in-place 
concrete piles constructed with a base that is larger than the 
diameter of the remainder of the pile. The enlarged base is 
designed to increase the load-bearing area of the pile in end 
bearing. 

Steel-cased piles. Steel-cased piles are constructed by driv- 
ing a steel shell into the soil to shore an unexcavated hole. 
The steel casing is left permanently in place and filled with 
concrete. 

I Timber piles. Timber piles are round, tapered timbers with 
the small (tip) end embedded into the soil. 

1808.2 Piers and piles — general requirements. 

1808.2.1 Design. Piles are permitted to be designed in 
accordance with provisions for piers in Section 1808 and

lowing: 

1 . Recommended pier or pile types and installed capaci- 
ties. 

2. Recommended center-to-center spacing of piers or 
piles. 

3. Driving criteria. 

4. Installation procedures. 

5. Field inspection and reporting procedures (to include 
procedures for verification of the installed bearing 
capacity where required). 

6. Pier or pile load test requirements, 

7. Durability of pier or pile materials. 



8. Designation of bearing stratum or strata, 

9. Reductions for group action, where necessary. 

1808.2.3 Special types of piles. The use of types of piles not 
specifically mentioned herein is permitted, subject to the 
approval of the building official, upon the submission of 
acceptable test data, calculations and other information 
relating to the structural properties and load capacity of such 
piles. The allowable stresses shall not in any case exceed the 
limitations specified herein. 

1808.2.4 Pile caps. Pile caps shall be of reinforced concrete, 
and shall include all elements to which piles are connected, 
including grade beams and mats. The soil immediately 
below the pile cap shall not be considered as carrying any 
vertical load. The tops of piles shall be embedded not less 
than 3 inches (76 mm) into pile caps and the caps shall 
extend at least 4 inches (102 mm) beyond the edges of piles. 
The tops of piles shall be cut back to sound material before 
capping. 

1808.2.5 Stability. Piers or piles shall be braced to provide 
lateral stability in all directions. Three or more piles con- 
nected by a rigid cap shall be considered braced, provided 
that the piles are located in radial directions from the cen- 
troid of the group not less than 60 degrees (1 rad) apart. A 
two-pile group in a rigid cap shall be considered to be 
braced along the axis connecting the two piles. Methods 
used to brace piers or piles shall be subject to the approval of 
the building official. 

Piles supporting walls shall be driven alternately in lines 
spaced at least 1 foot (305 mm) apart and located symmet- 
rically under the center of gravity of the wall load carried, 
unless effective measures are taken to provide for eccen- 
tricity and lateral forces, or the wall piles are adequately 
braced to provide for lateral stability. A single row of piles 
without lateral bracing is permitted for one- and two-fam- 
ily dwellings and lightweight construction not exceeding 
two stories or 35 feet (10 668 mm) in height, provided the 
centers of the piles are located within the width of the foun- 
dation wall. 

1808.2.6 Structural integrity. Piers or piles shall be 
installed in such a manner and sequence as to prevent distor- 
tion or damage that may adversely affect the structural I 
integrity of piles being installed or already in place. | 

1808.2.7 Splices. Splices shall be constructed so as to pro- 
vide and maintain true alignment and position of the compo- 
nent parts of the pier or pile during installation and 
subsequent thereto and shall be of adequate strength to 
transmit the vertical and lateral loads and moments occur- 
ring at the location of the splice during driving and under 
service loading. Splices shall develop not less than 50 per- 
cent of the least capacity of the pier or pile in bending. In 
addition, splices occurring in the upper 10 feet (3048 mm) 
of the embedded portion of the pier or pile shall be capable 
of resisting at allowable working stresses the moment and 
shear that would result from an assumed eccentricity of the 
pier or pile load of 3 inches (76 mm), or the pier or pile shall 
be braced in accordance with Section 1 808 .2.5 to other piers 
or piles that do not have splices in the upper 10 feet (3048 
mm) of embedment.

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 



1808.2.8 Allowable pier or pile loads. 

1808.2.8.1 Determination of allowable loads. The 

allowable axial and lateral loads on piers or piles shall be 
determined by an approved formula, load tests or method 
of analysis. 

1808.2.8.2 Driving criteria. The allowable compressive 
load on any pile where determined by the application of 
an approved driving formula shall not exceed 40 tons 
(356 kN). For allowable loads above 40 tons (356 kN), 
the wave equation method of analysis shall be used to 
estimate pile driveability of both driving stresses and net 
displacement per blow at the ultimate load. Allowable 
loads shall be verified by load tests in accordance with 
Section 1808.2.8.3. The formula or wave equation load 
shall be determined for gravity-drop or power-actuated 
hammers and the hammer energy used shall be the maxi- 
mum consistent with the size, strength and weight of the 
driven piles. The use of a follower is permitted only with 
the approval of the building official. The introduction of 
fresh hammer cushion or pile cushion material just prior 
to final penetration is not permitted. 

1808.2.8.3 Load tests. Where design compressive loads 
per pier or pile are greater than those permitted by Sec- 
tion 1808.2.10 or where the design load for any pier or 
pile foundation is in doubt, control test piers or piles shall 
be tested in accordance with ASTM D 1 143 or ASTM D 
4945. At least one pier or pile shall be test loaded in each 
area of uniform subsoil conditions. Where required by 
the building official, additional piers or piles shall be 
load tested where necessary to establish the safe design 
capacity. The resulting allowable loads shall not be more 
than one-half of the ultimate axial load capacity of the 
test pier or pile as assessed by one of the pubUshed meth- 
ods Hsted in Section 1808.2.8.3.1 with consideration for 
the test type, duration and subsoil. The ultimate axial 
load capacity shall be determined by a registered design 
professional with consideration given to tolerable total 
and differential settlements at design load in accordance 
with Section 1808.2.12. In subsequent installation of the 
balance of foundation piles, all piles shall be deemed to 
have a supporting capacity equal to the control pile 
where such piles are of the same type, size and relative 
length as the test pile; are installed using the same or 
comparable methods and equipment as the test pile; are 
installed in similar subsoil conditions as the test pile; 
and, for driven piles, where the rate of penetration (e.g., 
net displacement per blow) of such piles is equal to or 
less than that of the test pile driven with the same hammer 
through a comparable driving distance. 

1808.2.8.3.1 Load test evaluation. It shall be permit- 
ted to evaluate pile load tests with any of the following 
methods: 

1. Davisson Offset Limit. 

2. Brinch-Hansen 90% Criterion. 

3. Butler-Hoy Criterion. 

4. Other methods approved by the building offi- 
cial. 



1808.2.8.4 Allowable frictional resistance. The 

assumed frictional resistance developed by any pier or 
uncased cast-in-place pile shall not exceed one-sixth of 
the bearing value of the soil material at minimum depth 
as set forth in Table 1804.2, up to a maximum of 500 psf 
(24 kPa), unless a greater value is allowed by the building 
official after a soil investigation, as specified in Section 
1 802, is submitted or a greater value is substantiated by a | 
load test in accordance with Section 1808.2.8.3. Fric- I 
tional resistance and bearing resistance shall not be 
assumed to act simultaneously unless recommended by a 
soil investigation as specified in Section 1802. 

1808.2.8.5 Uplift capacity. Where required by the 
design, the uplift capacity of a single pier or pile shall be 
determined by an approved method of analysis based on 
a minimum factor of safety of three or by load tests con- 
ducted in accordance with ASTM D 3689. The maxi- 
mum allowable uplift load shall not exceed the ultimate 
load capacity as determined in Section 1808.2.8.3 
divided by a factor of safety of two. For pile groups sub- 
jected to uplift, the allowable working uplift load for the 
group shall be the lesser of: 

1. The proposed individual pile uplift working load 
times the number of piles in the group. 

2. Two-thirds of the effective weight of the pile 
group and the soil contained within a block defined 
by the perimeter of the group and the length of the 
pile. 

1808.2.8.6 Load-bearing capacity. Piers, individual 
piles and groups of piles shall develop ultimate load 
capacities of at least twice the design working loads in 
the designated load-bearing layers. Analysis shall show 
that no soil layer underlying the designated load-bearing 
layers causes the load-bearing capacity safety factor to 
be less than two. 

1808.2.8.7 Bent piers or piles. The load-bearing capac- 
ity of piers or piles discovered to have a sharp or sweep- 
ing bend shall be determined by an approved method of 
analysis or by load testing a representative pier or pile. 

1808.2.8.8 Overloads on piers or piles. The maximum 
compressive load on any pier or pile due to mislocation 
shall not exceed 110 percent of the allowable design 
load. 

1808.2.9 Lateral support. 

1808.2.9.1 General. Any soil other than fluid soil shall 
be deemed to afford sufficient lateral support to the pier 
or pile to prevent buckling and to permit the design of the 
pier or pile in accordance with accepted engineering 
practice and the applicable provisions of this code. 

1808.2.9.2 Unbraced piles. Piles standing unbraced in 
air, water or in fluid soils shall be designed as columns in 
accordance with the provisions of this code. Such piles 
driven into firm ground can be considered fixed and lat- 
erally supported at 5 feet (1524 mm) below the ground 
surface and in soft material at 10 feet (3048 mm) below 
the ground surface unless otherwise prescribed by the

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 



building official after a foundation investigation by an 
approved agency. 

1808.2.9.3 Allowable lateral load. Where required by 
the design, the lateral load capacity of a pier, a single pile 
or a pile group shall be determined by an approved 
method of analysis or by lateral load tests to at least twice 
the proposed design working load. The resulting allow- 
able load shall not be more than one-half of that test load 
that produces a gross lateral movement of 1 inch (25 mm) 
at the ground surface. 

1808.2.10 Use of higher allowable pier or pile stresses. 

Allowable stresses greater than those specified for piers or 
for each pile type in Sections 1809 and 1810 are permitted 
where supporting data justifying such higher stresses is filed 
with the building official. Such substantiating data shall 
include: 

1. A soils investigation in accordance with Section 
1802. 

2. Pier or pile load tests in accordance with Section 
1808.2.8.3, regardless of the load supported by the 
pier or pile. 

The design and installation of the pier or pile foundation 
shall be under the direct supervision of a registered design 
professional knowledgeable in the field of soil mechanics 
and pier or pile foundations who shall certify to the building 
official that the piers or piles as installed satisfy the design 
criteria. 

1808.2.11 Piles in subsiding areas. Where piles are 
installed through subsiding fills or other subsiding strata 
and derive support from underlying firmer materials, con- 
sideration shall be given to the downward frictional forces 
that may be imposed on the piles by the subsiding upper 
strata. 

Where the influence of subsiding fills is considered as 
imposing loads on the pile, the allowable stresses specified 
in this chapter are permitted to be increased where satisfac- 
tory substantiating data are submitted. 

1808.2.12 Settlement analysis. The settlement of piers, 
individual piles or groups of piles shall be estimated based 
on approved methods of analysis. The predicted settlement 
shall cause neither harmful distortion of, nor instability in, 
the structure, nor cause any stresses to exceed allowable val- 
ues. 

1808.2.13 Preexcavation. The use of jetting, angering or 
other methods of preexcavation shall be subject to the 
approval of the building official. Where permitted, 
preexcavation shall be carried out in the same manner as 
used for piers or piles subject to load tests and in such a man- 
ner that will not impair the carrying capacity of the piers or 
piles already in place or damage adjacent structures. Pile 
tips shall be driven below the preexcavated depth until the 
required resistance or penetration is obtained. 

1808.2.14 Installation sequence. Piles shall be installed in 
such sequence as to avoid compacting the surrounding soil 



to the extent that other piles cannot be installed properly, 
and to prevent ground movements that are capable of dam- 
aging adjacent structures. 

1808.2.15 Use of vibratory drivers. Vibratory drivers shall 
only be used to install piles where the pile load capacity is 
verified by load tests in accordance with Section 1 808.2.8.3. 
The installation of production piles shall be controlled 
according to power consumption, rate of penetration or 
other approved means that ensure pile capacities equal or 
exceed those of the test piles. 

1808.2.16 Pile driveability. Pile cross sections shall be of 
sufficient size and strength to withstand driving stresses 
without damage to the pile, and to provide sufficient stiff- 
ness to transmit the required driving forces. 

1808.2.17 Protection of pile materials. Where boring 
records or site conditions indicate possible deleterious 
action on pier or pile materials because of soil constituents, 
changing water levels or other factors, the pier or pile mate- 
rials shall be adequately protected by materials, methods or 
processes approved by the building official. Protective 
materials shall be applied to the piles so as not to be rendered 
ineffective by driving. The effectiveness of such protective 
measures for the particular purpose shall have been thor- 
oughly established by satisfactory service records or other 
evidence. 

1808.2.18 Use of existing piers or piles. Piers or piles left 
in place where a structure has been demolished shall not be 
used for the support of new construction unless satisfactory 
evidence is submitted to the building official, which indi- 
cates that the piers or piles are sound and meet the require- 
ments of this code. Such piers or piles shall be load tested or 
redriven to verify their capacities. The design load applied 
to such piers or piles shall be the lowest allowable load as 
determined by tests or redriving data. 

1808.2.19 Heaved piles. Piles that have heaved during the 
driving of adjacent piles shall be redriven as necessary to 
develop the required capacity and penetration, or the capac- 
ity of the pile shall be verified by load tests in accordance 
with Section 1808.2.8.3. . 

1808.2.20 Identification. Pier or pile materials shall be 
identified for conformity to the specified grade with this 
identity maintained continuously from the point of manu- 
facture to the point of installation or shall be tested by an 
approved agency to determine conformity to the specified 
grade. The approved agency shall furnish an affidavit of 
compliance to the building official. 

1808.2.21 Pier or pile location plan. A plan showing the 
location and designation of piers or piles by an identifica- 
tion system shall be filed with the building official prior to 
installation of such piers or piles. Detailed records for piers 
or individual piles shall bear an identification correspond- 
ing to that shown on the plan. 

1808.2.22 Special inspection. Special inspections in accor- 
dance with Sections 1704.8 and 1704.9 shall be provided 
for piles and piers, respectively.

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 



1808.2.23 Seismic design of piers or piles. 

1808.2.23.1 Seismic Design Category C. Where a 
structure is assigned to Seismic Design Category C in 
accordance with Section 1613, the following shall apply. 
Individual pile caps, piers or piles shall be intercon- 
nected by ties. Ties shall be capable of carrying, in ten- 
sion and compression, a force equal to the product of the 
larger pile cap or column load times the seismic coeffi- 
cient, Sps, divided by 10 unless it can be demonstrated 
that equivalent restraint is provided by reinforced con- 
crete beams within slabs on grade, reinforced concrete 
slabs on grade, confinement by competent rock, hard 
cohesive soils or very dense granular soils. 

Exception: Piers supporting foundation walls, iso- 
lated interior posts detailed so the pier is not subject to 
lateral loads, lightly loaded exterior decks and patios 
of Group R-3 and U occupancies not exceeding two 
stories of light-frame construction, are not subject to 
interconnection if it can be shown the soils are of ade- 
quate stiffness, subject to the approval of the building 
official. 

1808.2.23.1.1 Connection to pile cap. Concrete piles 
and concrete-filled steel pipe piles shall be connected 
to the pile cap by embedding the pile reinforcement or 
field-placed dowels anchored in the concrete pile in 
the pile cap for a distance equal to the development 
length. For deformed bars, the development length is 
the full development length for compression or ten- 
sion, in the case of uplift, without reduction in length 
for excess area. Alternative measures for laterally 
confining concrete and maintaining toughness and 
ductile-like behavior at the top of the pile will be per- 
mitted provided the design is such that any hinging 
occurs in the confined region. 

Ends of hoops, spirals and ties shall be terminated 
with seismic hooks, as defined in Section 21 . 1 of ACI 
318, turned into the confined concrete core. The mini- 
mum transverse steel ratio for confinement shall not 
be less than one-half of that required for columns. 

For resistance to uplift forces, anchorage of steel 
pipe (round HSS sections), concrete-filled steel pipe 
or H-piles to the pile cap shall be made by means other 
than concrete bond to the bare steel section. 

Exception: Anchorage of concrete-filled steel 
pipe piles is permitted to be accomplished using 
deformed bars developed into the concrete portion 
of the pile. 

Splices of pile segments shall develop the full 
strength of the pile, but the splice need not develop the 
nominal strength of the pile in tension, shear and 
bending when it has been designed to resist axial and 
shear forces and moments from the load combina- 
tions of Section 1605.4. 

1808.2.23.1.2 Design details. Pier or pile moments, 
shears and lateral deflections used for design shall be 
established considering the nonlinear interaction of 
the shaft and soil, as recommended by a registered 



design professional. Where the ratio of the depth of 
embedment of the pile-to-pile diameter or width is 
less than or equal to six, the pile may be assumed to be 
rigid. 

Pile group effects from soil on lateral pile nominal 
strength shall be included where pile center-to-center 
spacing in the direction of lateral force is less than 
eight pile diameters. Pile group effects on vertical 
nominal strength shall be included where pile cen- 
ter-to-center spacing is less than three pile diameters. 
The pile uplift soil nominal strength shall be taken as 
the pile uplift strength as limited by the frictional 
force developed between the soil and the pile. 

Where a minimum length for reinforcement or the 
extent of closely spaced confinement reinforcement is 
specified at the top of the pier or pile, provisions shall 
be made so that those specified lengths or extents are 
maintained after pier or pile cutoff. 

1808.2.23.2 Seismic Design Category D, E or E Where 
a structure is assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E 
or F in accordance with Section 1613, the requirements 
for Seismic Design Category C given in Section 
1808.2.23.1 shall be met, in addition to the following. 
Provisions of ACI 318, Section 21.10.4, shall apply 
when not in conflict with the provisions of Sections 1 808 
through 1812. Concrete shall have a specified compres- 
sive strength of not less than 3,000 psi (20.68 MPa) at 28 
days. 

Exceptions: 

1 . Group R or U occupancies of light-framed con- 
struction and two stories or less in height are 
permitted to use concrete with a specified com- 
pressive strength of not less than 2,500 psi (17.2 
MPa) at 28 days. 

2. Detached one- and two-family dwellings of 
light-frame construction and two stories or less 
in height are not required to comply with the 
provisions of ACI 318, Section 21.10.4. 

3. Section 21 .10.4.4( a) of ACI 318 need not apply 
to concrete piles. 

1808.2.23.2.1 Design details for piers, piles and 
grade beams. Piers or piles shall be designed and 
constructed to withstand maximum imposed curva- 
tures from earthquake ground motions and structure 
response. Curvatures shall include free-field soil 
strains modified for soil-pile-structure interaction 
coupled with pier or pile deformations induced by lat- 
eral pier or pile resistance to structure seismic forces. 
Concrete piers or piles on Site Class E or F sites, as 
deterrnined in Section 1613.5.2, shall be designed and 
detailed in accordance with Sections 21.4.4.1, 
21.4.4.2 and 21.4.4.3 of ACI 318 within seven pile 
diameters of the pile cap and the interfaces of soft to 
medium stiff clay or liquefiable strata. For precast 
prestressed concrete piles, detailing provisions as 
given in Sections 1809.2.3.2.1 and 1809.2.3.2.2 shall 
apply. Grade beams shall be designed as beams in 



362 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE® 



SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS 



accordance with ACI 318, Chapter 21. When grade 
beams have the capacity to resist the forces from the 
load combinations in Section 1605.4, they need not 
conform to ACI 318, Chapter 21. 

1808.2.23.2.2 Connection to pile cap. For piles 
required to resist uplift forces or provide rotational 
restraint, design of anchorage of piles into the pile cap 
shall be provided considering the combined effect of 
axial forces due to uplift and bending moments due to 
fixity to the pile cap. Anchorage shall develop a mini- 
mum of 25 percent of the strength of the pile in ten- 
sion. Anchorage into the pile cap shall be capable of 
developing the following: 

1 . In the case of uplift, the lesser of the nominal 
tensile strength of the longitudinal reinforce- 
ment in a concrete pile, or the nominal tensile 
strength of a steel pile, or the pile upUft soil 
nominal strength factored by 1.3 or the axial 
tension force resulting from the load combina- 
tions of Section 1605.4. 

2. In the case of rotational restraint, the lesser of 
the axial and shear forces, and moments result- 
ing from the load combinations of Section 
1605.4 or development of the full axial, bend- 
ing and shear nominal strength of the pile. 

1808.2.23.2.3 Flexural strength. Where the vertical 
lateral-force-resisting elements are columns, the 
grade beam or pile cap flexural strengths shall exceed 
the column flexural strength. 

The connection between batter piles and grade 
beams or pile caps shall be designed to resist the nom- 
inal strength of the pile acting as a short column. Bat- 
ter piles and their connection shall be capable of 
resisting forces and moments from the load combina- 
tions of Section 1605.4.

1913.1 General. Shotcrete is mortar or concrete that is pneu- 
matically projected at high velocity onto a surface. Except as 
specified in this section, shotcrete shall conform to the require- 
ments of this chapter for plain or reinforced concrete. 

1913.2 Proportions and materials. Shotcrete proportions 
shall be selected that allow suitable placement procedures 
using the delivery equipment selected and shall result in fin- 
ished in-place hardened shotcrete meeting the strength require- 
ments of this code. 

1913.3 Aggregate. Coarse aggregate, if used, shall not exceed 
% inch (19.1 mm). 

1913.4 Reinforcement. Reinforcement used in shotcrete con- 
struction shall comply with the provisions of Sections 1913.4.1 
through 1913.4.4. 

1913.4.1 Size. The maximum size of reinforcement shall be 
No. 5 bars unless it is demonstrated by preconstruction tests 
that adequate encasement of larger bars will be achieved. 

1913.4.2 Clearance. When No. 5 or smaller bars are used, 
there shall be a minimum clearance between parallel rein- 
forcement bars of 2V2 inches (64 mm). When bars larger 
than No. 5 are permitted, there shall be a minimum clear- 
ance between parallel bars equal to six diameters of the bars 
used. When two curtains of steel are provided, the curtain 
nearer the nozzle shall have a minimum spacing equal to 12 
bar diameters and the remaining curtain shall have a mini- 
mum spacing of six bar diameters. 

Exception: Subject to the approval of the building offi- 
cial, required clearances shall be reduced where it is 
demonstrated by preconstruction tests that adequate 
encasement of the bars used in the design will be 
achieved. 



1913.4.3 Splices. Lap splices of reinforcing bars shall uti- 
lize the noncontact lap splice method with a minimum clear- 
ance of 2 inches (5 1 mm) between bars. The use of contact 
lap splices necessary for support of the reinforcing is per- 
mitted when approved by the building official, based on sat- 
isfactory preconstruction tests that show that adequate 
encasement of the bars will be achieved, and provided that 
the splice is oriented so that a plane through the center of the 
spliced bars is perpendicular to the surface of the shotcrete.

tern, special considerations shall be made when the over- 
hang exceeds 18 inches (457 mm), 24 inches (610 mm) 
or 36 inches (914 mm) for 2-inch (51 mm), 3-inch (76 
mm) or 4-inch (102 mm) nominal thickness decking, 
respectively. The maximum cantilevered length for the 
controlled random pattern shall be 30 percent of the 
length of the first adjacent interior span. For cantilever 
overhangs within these limits, a structural fascia shall be 
fastened to each decking piece to maintain a continuous, 
straight roof line. There shall be no end joints in the can- 
tilevered portion or within one-half of the first adjacent 
interior span.

2304.8.4 Two-inch sawn tongue-and-groove decking. 

2304.8.4.1 General. Two-inch (51 mm) decking shall 
have a maximum moisture content of 15 percent. Deck- 
ing shall be machined with a single tongue-and-groove 
pattern. Each deck piece shall be nailed to each support 
as required. 

2304.8.4.2 Nailing. Each piece of decking shall be 
toenailed at each support with one 16d common nail 
through the tongue and face-nailed with one 16d com- 
mon nail. 

2304.8.4.3 Controlled random pattern. There shall be 
a minimum distance of 24 inches (610 mm) between end 
joints in adjacent courses. The pieces in the first and sec- 
ond courses shall bear on at least two supports with end 
joints in these two courses occurring on alternate sup- 
ports. A maximum of seven intervening courses shall be 
permitted before this pattern is repeated. 

2304.8.5 Three- and 4-inch sawn tongue-and-groove 
decking. 

2304.8.5.1 General. Three-inch (76 mm) and 4-inch 
(102 mm) decking shall have a maximum moisture con- 
tent of 19 percent. Decking shall be machined with a 
double tongue-and-groove pattern. Deck pieces shall be 
interconnected and fastened to the supports as required. 

2304.8.5.2 Nailing. Each piece shall be toenailed at each 
support with one 40d common nail and face-nailed with 
one 60d common nail. Courses shall be spiked to each 
other with 8 -inch (203 mm) spikes at intervals not to 
exceed 30 inches (762 mm) through predrilled edge 
holes penetrating to a depth of approximately 4 inches 
(102 mm) and with one spike at a distance not exceeding 
10 inches (254 mm) from the end of each piece. 

2304.8.5.3 Controlled random pattern. There shall be 
a minimum distance of 48 inches (1219 mm) between 
end joints in adjacent courses. Pieces not bearing over a 
support are permitted to occur in interior bays, provided 
the adjacent pieces in the same course continue over the 
support for at least 24 inches (610 mm). This condition 
shall not occur more than once in every six courses in 
each interior bay. 

2304.9 Connections and fasteners. 

2304.9.1 Fastener requirements. Connections for wood 
members shall be designed in accordance with the appropri- 
ate methodology in Section 2301.2. The number and size of 
fasteners connecting wood members shall not be less than 
that set forth in Table 2304.9.1. 

2304.9.2 Sheathing fasteners. Sheathing nails or other 
approved sheathing connectors shall be driven so that their 
head or crown is flush with the surface of the sheathing. 

2304.9.3 Joist hangers and framing anchors. Connec- 
tions depending on joist hangers or framing anchors, ties 
and other mechanical fastenings not otherwise covered are 
permitted where approved. The vertical load-bearing capac- 
ity, torsional moment capacity and deflection characteris- 
tics of joist hangers shall be determined in accordance with 
Section 1715.1. 



2304.9.4 Other fasteners. Clips, staples, glues and other 
approved methods of fastening are permitted where 
approved. 

2304.9.5 Fasteners in preservative-treated and 
fire-retardant-treated wood. Fasteners for preservative- 
treated and fire-retardant-treated wood shall be of hot 
dipped zinc-coated galvanized steel, stainless steel, siUcon 
bronze or copper. The coating weights for zinc-coated fas- 
teners shall be in accordance with ASTM A 153. 

Exception: Fasteners other than nails, timber rivets, 
wood screws and lag screws shall be permitted to be of 
mechanically deposited zinc coated steel with coating 
weights in accordance with ASTM B 695, Class 55 mini- 
mum. 

Fastenings for wood foundations shall be as required in 
AF&amp;PA Technical Report No. 7. 

2304.9.6 Load path. Where wall framing members are not 
continuous from foundation sill to roof, the members shall 
be secured to ensure a continuous load path. Where 
required, sheet metal clamps, ties or clips shall be formed of 
galvanized steel or other approved corrosion-resistant mate- 
rial not less than 0.040 inch (1.01 mm) nominal thickness. 

2304.9.7 Framing requirements. Wood columns and posts 
shall be framed to provide full end bearing. Alternatively, 
column-and-post end connections shall be designed to resist 
the full compressive loads, neglecting end-bearing capacity. 
Column-and-post end connections shall be fastened to resist 
lateral and net induced uplift forces. 

2304.10 Heavy timber construction. 

2304.10.1 Columns. Columns shall be continuous or super- 
imposed throughout all stories by means of reinforced con- 
crete or metal caps with brackets, or shall be connected by 
properly designed steel or iron caps, with pintles and base 
plates, or by timber splice plates affixed to the columns by 
metal connectors housed within the contact faces, or by 
other approved methods. 

2304.10.1.1 Column connections. Girders and beams 
shall be closely fitted around columns and adjoining 
ends shall be cross tied to each other, or intertied by caps 
or ties, to transfer horizontal loads across joints. Wood 
bolsters shall not be placed on tops of columns unless the 
columns support roof loads only. 

2304.10.2 Floor framing. Approved wall plate boxes or 
hangers shall be provided where wood beams, girders or 
trusses rest on masonry or concrete walls. Where intermedi- 
ate beams are used to support a floor, they shall rest on top of 
girders, or shall be supported by ledgers or blocks securely 
fastened to the sides of the girders, or they shall be sup- 
ported by an approved metal hanger into which the ends of 
the beams shall be closely fitted. 

2304.10.3 Roof framing. Every roof girder and at least 
every alternate roof beam shall be anchored to its supporting 
member; and every monitor and every sawtooth construc- 
tion shall be anchored to the main roof construction. Such 
anchors shall consist of steel or iron bolts of sufficient 
strength to resist vertical uplift of the roof

SECTION 2305 

GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR 

LATERAL-FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEMS 

2305.1 General. Structures using wood shear walls and dia- 
phragms to resist wind, seismic and other lateral loads shall be 
designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of 
this section. Alternatively, compliance with the AF&amp;PA 
SDPWS shall be permitted subject to the limitations therein and 
the limitations of this code. 

2305.1.1 Shear resistance based on principles of mechan- 
ics. Shear resistance of diaphragms and shear walls are per- 
mitted to be calculated by principles of mechanics using 
values of fastener strength and sheathing shear resistance. 

2305.1.2 Framing. Boundary elements shall be provided to 
transmit tension and compression forces. Perimeter mem- 
bers at openings shall be provided and shall be detailed to 
distribute the shearing stresses. Diaphragm and shear wall 
sheathing shall not be used to splice boundary elements. 
Diaphragm chords and collectors shall be placed in, or tan- 
gent to, the plane of the diaphragm framing unless it can be 
demonstrated that the moments, shears and deformations, 
considering eccentricities resulting from other configura- 
tions can be tolerated without exceeding the adjusted resis- 
tance and drift limits. 



2305.1.2.1 Framing members. Framing members shall 
be at least 2 inch (51 mm) nominal width. In general, 
adjoining panel edges shall bear and be attached to the 
framing members and butt along their centerlines. Nails 
shall be placed not less than % inch (9.5 mm) from the 
panel edge, not more than 12 inches (305 mm) apart 
along intermediate supports, and 6 inches (152 mm) 
along panel edge bearings, and shall be firmly driven into 
the framing members. 

2305.1.3 Openings in shear panels. Openings in shear 
panels that materially affect their strength shall be fully 
detailed on the plans, and shall have their edges adequately 
reinforced to transfer all shearing stresses. 

2305.1.4 Shear panel connections. Positive connections 
and anchorages capable of resisting the design forces shall 
be provided between the shear panel and the attached com- 
ponents. In Seismic Design Category D, E or F, the capacity 
of toenail connections shall not be used when calculating 
lateral load resistance to transfer lateral earthquake forces in 
excess of 150 pounds per foot (2189 N/m) from diaphragms 
to shear walls, drag struts (collectors) or other elements, or 
from shear walls to other elements. 

2305.1.5 Wood members resisting horizontal seismic 
forces contributed by masonry and concrete walls. Wood 
shear walls, diaphragms, horizontal trusses and other mem- 
bers shall not be used to resist horizontal seismic forces con- 
tributed by masonry or concrete walls in structures over one 
story in height. 

Exceptions: 

1 . Wood floor and roof members are permitted to be 
used in horizontal trusses and diaphragms to resist 
horizontal seismic forces contributed by masonry 
or concrete walls, provided such forces do not 
result in torsional force distribution through the 
truss or diaphragm. 

2. Wood structural panel sheathed shear walls are 
permitted to be used to provide resistance to seis- 
mic forces contributed by masonry or concrete 
walls in two-story structures of masonry or con- 
crete walls, provided the following requirements 
are met: 

2.1. Story-to-story wall heights shall not 
exceed 12 feet (3658 mm). 

2.2. Diaphragms shall not be designed to trans- 
mit lateral forces by rotation and shall not 
cantilever past the outermost supporting 
shear wall. 

2.3. Combined deflections of diaphragms and 
shear walls shall not permit story drift of 
supported masonry or concrete walls to 
exceed the limit of Section 12.12.1 in 
ASCE 7. 

2.4. Wood structural panel sheathing in dia- 
phragms shall have unsupported edges 
blocked. Wood structural panel sheathing 
for both stories of shear walls shall have 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE'' 



435 



WOOD 



unsupported edges blocked and, for the 
lower story, shall have a minimum thick- 
ness of ^V32 inch (11. 9 mm). 

2.5. There shall be no out-of-plane horizontal 
offsets between the first and second stories 
of wood structural panel shear walls. 

2305.1.6 Wood members resisting seismic forces from 
nonstructural concrete or masonry. Wood members shall 
be permitted to resist horizontal seismic forces from 
nonstructural concrete, masonry veneer or concrete floors. 

2305.2 Design of wood diaphragms. 

2305.2.1 General. Wood diaphragms are permitted to be 
used to resist horizontal forces provided the deflection in 
the plane of the diaphragm, as determined by calculations, 
tests or analogies drawn therefrom, does not exceed the 
permissible deflection of attached distributing or resisting 
elements. Connections shall extend into the diaphragm a 
sufficient distance to develop the force transferred into the 
diaphragm. 

2305.2.2 Deflection. Permissible deflection shall be that 
deflection up to which the diaphragm and any attached dis- 
tributing or resisting element will maintain its structural 
integrity under design load conditions, such that the resist- 
ing element will continue to support design loads without 
danger to occupants of the structure. Calculations for dia- 
phragm deflection shall account for the usual bending and 
shear components as well as any other factors, such as nail 
deformation, which will contribute to deflection. 

The deflection (A) of a blocked wood structural panel 
diaphragm uniformly nailed throughout is permitted to be 
calculated by using the following equation. If not uniformly 
nailed, the constant 0.188 (For SI: Vjgj?) in the third term 
must be modified accordingly.

2305.2.4.1 Seismic Design Category F. Structures 
assigned to Seismic Design Category F shall conform to 
the additional requirements of this section. 

Wood structural panel sheathing used for diaphragms 
and shear walls that are part of the seismic-force-resist- 
ing system shall be applied directly to the framing mem- 
bers. 

Exception: Wood structural panel sheathing in a dia- 
phragm is permitted to be fastened over soUd lumber 
planking or laminated decking, provided the panel 
joints and lumber planking or laminated decking 
joints do not coincide. 

2305.2.5 Rigid diaphragms. Design of structures with 
rigid diaphragms shall conform to the structure configura- 
tion requirements of Section 12.3.2 of ASCE 7 and the hori- 
zontal shear distribution requirements of Section 12.8.4 of 
ASCE 7. 

Open-front structures with rigid wood diaphragms result- 
ing in torsional force distribution are permitted, provided 
the length, /, of the diaphragm normal to the open side does 
not exceed 25 feet (7620 mm), the diaphragm sheathing 
conforms to Section 2305.2.4 and the l/w ratio [as shown in 
Figure 2305.2.5(1)] is less than 1 for one-story structures or 
0.67 for structures over one story in height. 

Exception: Where calculations show that diaphragm 
deflections can be tolerated, the length, /, normal to the 
open end is permitted to be increased to a l/w ratio not 
greater than 1.5 where sheathed in compliance with Sec- 
tion 2305.2.4 or to 1 where sheathed in compliance with 
Section 2306.3.4 or 2306.3.5. 

Rigid wood diaphragms are permitted to cantilever past 
the outermost supporting shearwall (or other vertical resist- 
ing element) a length, /, of not more than 25 feet (7620 mm) 
or two-thirds of the diaphragm width, w, whichever is 
smaller. Figure 2305.2.5(2) illustrates the dimensions of / 
and w for a cantilevered diaphragm. 

Structures with rigid wood diaphragms having a torsional 
irregularity in accordance with Table 12.3-1, Item 1, of 
ASCE 7 shall meet the following requirements: the l/w ratio 



shall not exceed 1 for one-story structures or 0.67 for 
structures over one story in height, where / is the dimension 
parallel to the load direction for which the irregularity

Exception: Where calculations demonstrate that the dia- 
phragm deflections can be tolerated, the width is permit- 
ted to be increased and the l/w ratio is permitted to be 
increased to 1.5 where sheathed in compliance with Sec- 
tion 2305.2.4 or 1 where sheathed in compliance with 
Section 2306.3.4 or 2306.3.5. 

2305.3 Design of wood shear walls. 

2305.3.1 General. Wood shear walls are permitted to resist 
horizontal forces in vertical distributing or resisting ele- 
ments, provided the deflection in the plane of the shear wall, 
as determined by calculations, tests or analogies drawn 
therefrom, does not exceed the more restrictive of the per- 
missible deflection of attached distributing or resisting ele- 
ments or the drift limits of Section 1 2. 1 2. 1 of ASCE 7 . Shear 
wall sheathing other than wood structural panels shall not be 
permitted in Seismic Design Category E or F (see Section 
1613). 

2305.3.2 Deflection. Permissible deflection shall be that 
deflection up to which the shear wall and any attached dis- 
tributing or resisting element will maintain its structural 
integrity under design load conditions, i.e., continue to sup- 
port design loads without danger to occupants of the struc- 
ture. 

The deflection (A) of a blocked wood structural panel 
shear wall uniformly fastened throughout is permitted to be 
calculated by the use of the following equation:

device shall be provided. Anchoring devices shall maintain 
a continuous load path to the foundation. 

2305.3.8 Shear walls with openings. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to the design of shear walls with open- 
ings. Where framing and connections around the openings 
are designed for force transfer around the openings, the pro- 
visions of Section 2305.3.8.1 shall apply. Where framing 
and connections around the openings are not designed for 
force transfer around the openings, the provisions of Sec- 
tion 2305.3.8.2 shall apply. 

2305.3.8.1 Force transfer around openings. Where 
shear walls with openings are designed for force transfer

shall apply to the overall shear wall, including openings, 
and to each wall pier at the side of an opening. Design for 



force transfer shall be based on a rational analysis. 
Detailing of boundary elements around the opening shall

shall be designed by other methods. 

6. Perforated shear wall height, h, shall not exceed 
20 feet (6096 mm). 

2305.3.8.2.2 Perforated shear wall resistance. The 

resistance of a perforated shear wall shall be calcu- 
lated in accordance with the following: 

1 . The percentage of full-height sheathing shall be 
calculated as the sum of the widths of perforated 
shear wall segments divided by the total width of 
the perforated shear wall, including openings. 

2. The maximum opening height shall be taken as 
the maximum opening clear height. Where 
areas above and below an opening remain 
unsheathed, the height of the opening shall be

For seismic forces, where the height-to-width 
ratio of any perforated shear wall segment used 
in the calculation of the sum of the widths of 
perforated shear wall segments, Y, A&gt; is greater 
than 2:1 but does not exceed 3V2:1, the unad- 
justed shear resistance shall be multiplied by 2 
w/h.

ages of full-height sheathing, the values in 
Table 2305.3.8.2 are permitted to be interpo- 
lated.

2306.3 Wood diaphragms. 

2306.3.1 Wood structural panel diaphragms. Wood 
structural panel diaphragms are permitted to resist horizon- 
tal forces using the allowable shear capacities set forth in 
Table 2306.3.1 or 2306.3.2. The allowable shear capacities 
are permitted to be calculated by principles of mechanics 
without limitations by using values for fastener strength in 
the AF&amp;PA NDS, structural design properties for wood 
structural panels based on DOC PS-1 and DOC PS-2 or 
wood structural panel design properties given in the APA 
Panel Design Specification (PDS). 

2306.3.2 Shear capacities modifications. The allowable 
shear capacities in Tables 2306.3.1 and 2306.3.2 for hori- 
zontal wood structural panel diaphragms shall be increased 
40 percent for wind design. 

2306.3.3 Diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms. 

Diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms shall be nailed in 
accordance with Table 2306.3.3. 

2306.3.4 Single diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms. Single diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms 
shall be constructed of minimum 1-inch (25 mm) thick 
nominal sheathing boards laid at an angle of approximately 
45 degrees (0.78 rad) to the supports. The shear capacity for 
single diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms of southern 
pine or Douglas fir-larch shall not exceed 300 plf (4378 
N/m) of width. The shear capacities shall be adjusted by 
reduction factors of 0.82 for framing members of species 
with a specific gravity equal to or greater than 0.42 but less 



than 0.49 and 0.65 for species with a specific gravity of less 
than 0.42, as contained in the AF&amp;PA NDS. 

2306.3.4.1 End joints. End joints in adjacent boards 
shall be separated by at least one stud or joist space and 
there shall be at least two boards between joints on the 
same support. 

2306.3.4.2 Single diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms. Single diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms made up of 2-inch (51 nrni) nominal diagonal 
lumber sheathing fastened with 16d nails shall be 
designed with the same shear capacities as shear panels 
using 1-inch (25 mm) boards fastened with 8d nails, pro- 
vided there are not splices in adjacent boards on the same 
support and the supports are not less than 4 inch (102 
mm) nominal depth or 3 inch (76 mm) nominal thick- 
ness. 

2306.3.5 Double diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms. Double diagonally sheathed lumber dia- 
phragms shall be constructed of two layers of diagonal 
sheathing boards at 90 degrees (1.57 rad) to each other on 
the same face of the supporting members. Each chord 
shall be considered as a beam with uniform load per foot 
equal to 50 percent of the unit shear due to diaphragm 
action. The load shall be assumed as acting normal to the 
chord in the plan of the diaphragm in either direction. The 
span of the chord or portion thereof shall be the distance 
between framing members of the diaphragm, such as the 
joists, studs and blocking that serve to transfer the 
assumed load to the sheathing. The shear capacity of dou- 
ble diagonally sheathed diaphragms of Southern pine or 
Douglas fir-larch shall not exceed 600 plf (8756 kN/m) of 
width. The shear capacity shall be adjusted by reduction 
factors of 0. 82 for framing members of species with a spe- 
cific gravity equal to or greater than 0.42 but less than 
0.49 and 0.65 for species with a specific gravity of less 
than 0.42, as contained in the AF&amp;PA NDS. Nailing of 
diagonally sheathed lumber diaphragms shall be in accor- 
dance with Table 2306.3.3. 

2306.3.6 Gypsum board diaphragm ceilings. Gypsum 
board diaphragm ceilings shall be in accordance with Sec- 
tion 2508.5. 

2306.4 Shear walls. Panel sheathing joints in shear waUs shall 
occur over studs or blocking. Adjacent panel sheathing joints shall 
occur over and be nailed to conunon framing members (see Sec- 
tion 2305.3.1 for limitations on shear waU bracing materials).

Notes to Table 2306.4.1 

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per foot = 14.5939 N/m. 

a. For framing of other species: (1) Find specific gravity for species of lumber in AF&amp;PA NDS. (2) For staples find shear value from table above for Structural I 
panels (regardless of actual grade) and multiply value by 0.82 for species with specific gravity of 0.42 or greater, or 0.65 for all other species. (3) For nails find shear value from table above 
for nail size for actual grade and multiply value by the following adjustment factor: Specific Gravity Adjustment Factor = [I-(0.5 - SG)], where SG = Specific Gravity of the framing lumber. 
This adjustment factor shall not be greater than 1 . 

b. Panel edges backed with 2-inch nominal or wider framing. Install panels either horizontally or vertically. Space fasteners maximum 6 inches on center along intermediate framing members 
for Vg-inch and 7,6-inch panels installed on studs spaced 24 inches on center. For other conditions and panel thickness, space fasteners maximum 12 inches on center on intermediate 
supports. 

c. Vg-inch panel thickness or siding with a span rating of 16 inches on center is the minimum recommended where applied direct to framing as exterior siding. 

d. Allowable shear values are permitted to be increased to values shown for "A^-inch sheathing with same nailing provided (a) studs are spaced a maximum of 16 inches on center, or (b) 
panels are applied with long dimension across studs. 

e. Framing at adjoining panel edges shaU be 3 inches nominal or wider, and nails shall be staggered where nails are spaced 2 inches on center. 

f. Framing at adjoining panel edges shall be 3 inches nominal or wider, and nails shall be staggered where both of the following conditions are met: (1) lOd (3" x 0. 148") nails having 
penetration into framing of more than 1 Vj inches and (2) nails are spaced 3 inches on center. 

g. Values apply to all- veneer plywood. Thickness at point of fastening on panel edges governs shear values. 

h. Where panels apphed on both faces of a wall and nail spacing is less than 6 inches o.c. on either side, panel joints shall be offset to fall on different framing members, or 
framing shall be 3-inch nominal or thicker at adjoining panel edges and nails on each side shall be staggered. 

i. In Seismic Design Category D, E or F, where shear design values exceed 350 pounds per linear foot, all framing members receiving edge nailing from abutting panels shall not be 
less than a single 3-inch nominal member, or two 2-inch nominal members fastened together in accordance with Section 2306.1 to transfer the design shear value between framing 
members. Wood structural panel joint and sill plate nailing shall be staggered in all cases. See Section 2305.3.11 for sill plate size and anchorage requirements. 

j. Galvanized nails shall be hot dipped or tumbled. 

k. Staples shall have a minimum crown width of 7,6 inch and shall be installed with their crowns parallel to the long dimension of the framing members. 

1. For shear loads of normal or permanent load duration as defined by the AF&amp;PA NDS, the values in the table above shall be multiplied by 0.63 or 0.56, respectively.

2308.8.3 Framing around openings. Trimmer and header 
joists shall be doubled, or of lumber of equivalent cross sec- 
tion, where the span of the header exceeds 4 feet (1219 mm). 
The ends of header joists more than 6 feet (1829 mm) long 
shall be supported by framing anchors or joist hangers 
unless bearing on a beam, partition or wall. Tail joists over 
12 feet (3658 nrai) long shall be supported at the header by 
framing anchors or on ledger strips not less than 2 inches by 
2 inches (5 1 mm by 5 1 nmi). 

2308.8.4 Supporting bearing partitions. Bearing parti- 
tions parallel to joists shall be supported on beams, girders, 
doubled joists, walls or other bearing partitions. Bearing 
partitions perpendicular to joists shall not be offset from 
supporting girders, walls or partitions more than the joist 
depth unless such joists are of sufficient size to carry the 
additional load. 

2308.8.5 Lateral support. Floor, attic and roof framing 
with a nominal depth-to-thickness ratio greater than or 
equal to 5:1 shall have one edge held in line for the entire 
span. Where the nominal depth-to-thickness ratio of the 
framing member exceeds 6:1, there shall be one line of 
bridging for each 8 feet (2438 mm) of span, unless both 
edges of the member are held in line. The bridging shall 
consist of not less than 1-inch by 3-inch (25 mm by 76 mm) 
lumber, double nailed at each end, of equivalent metal 
bracing of equal rigidity, full-depth solid blocking or other 
approved means. A line of bridging shall also be required 
at supports where equivalent lateral support is not other- 
wise provided. 

2308.8.6 Structural floor sheathing. Structural floor 
sheathing shall comply with the provisions of Section 
2304.7.1. 

2308.8.7 Under-floor ventilation. For under-floor ventila- 
tion, see Section 1203.3. 

2308.9 Wall framing. 

2308.9.1 Size, height and spacing. The size, height and 
spacing of studs shall be in accordance with Table 2308.9.1 
except that utility-grade studs shall not be spaced more than 
16 inches (406 mm) o.c, or support more than a roof and 



ceiUng, or exceed 8 feet (2438 mm) in height for exterior 
walls and load-bearing walls or 10 feet (3048 mm) for inte- 
rior nonload-bearing walls. 

2308.9.2 Framing details. Studs shall be placed with their 
wide dimension perpendicular to the wall. Not less than three 
studs shall be installed at each comer of an exterior wall. 

Exception: At comers, two studs are permitted, provided 
wood spacers or backup cleats of Vg-mch-thick (9.5 mm) 
wood stmctural panel, %-inch (9.5 nrai) Type M "Exterior 
Glue" particleboard, 1 -inch-thick (25 mm) lumber or 
other approved devices that will serve as an adequate 
backing for the attachment of facing materials are used. 
Where fire-resistance ratings or shear values are involved, 
wood spacers, backup cleats or other devices shall not be 
used unless specifically approved for such use. 

2308.9.2.1 Top plates. Bearing and exterior wall studs 
shall be capped with double top plates installed to pro- 
vide overlapping at comers and at intersections with 
other partitions. End joints in double top plates shall be 
offset at least 48 inches (1219 mm), and shall be nailed 
with not less than eight 1 6d face nails on each side of the 
joint. Plates shall be a nominal 2 inches (5 1 mm) in depth 
and have a width at least equal to the width of the studs. 

Exception: A single top plate is permitted, provided 
the plate is adequately tied at joints, comers and inter- 
secting walls by at least the equivalent of 3-inch by 
6-inch (76 nmi by 152 mm) by 0.036-inch-thick 
(0.9 14 mm) galvanized steel that is nailed to each wall 
or segment of wall by six 8d nails or equivalent, pro- 
vided the rafters, joists or tmsses are centered over the 
studs with a tolerance of no more than 1 inch (25 mm). 

2308.9.2.2 Top plates for studs spaced at 24 inches 
(610 mm). Where bearing studs are spaced at 24-inch 
(610 mm) intervals and top plates are less than two 
2-inch by 6-inch (51 mm by 152 mm) or two 3-inch by 
4-inch (76 mm by 102 nmi) members and where the floor 
joists, floor tmsses or roof tmsses that they support are 
spaced at more than 16-inch (406 mm) intervals, such

Openings in nonbearing partitions are permitted to be 
framed with single studs and headers. Each end of a lintel or 
header shall have a length of bearing of not less than 1 Vj 
inches (38 mm) for the full width of the lintel. 

2308.9.8 Pipes in walls. Stud partitions containing plumb- 
ing, heating or other pipes shall be so framed and the joists 
underneath so spaced as to give proper clearance for the pip- 
ing. Where a partition containing such piping runs parallel 
to the floor joists, the joists underneath such partitions shall 
be doubled and spaced to permit the passage of such pipes 
and shall be bridged. Where plumbing, heating or other 
pipes are placed in or partly in a partition, necessitating the 
cutting of the soles or plates, a metal tie not less than 0.058 
inch (1.47 mm) (16 galvanized gage) and IV2 inches (38 
mm) wide shall be fastened to each plate across and to each 
side of the opening with not less than six 16d nails. 

2308.9.9 Bridging. Unless covered by interior or exterior 
wall coverings or sheathing meeting the minimum require- 
ments of this code, stud partitions or walls with studs having 
a height-to-least-thickness ratio exceeding 50 shall have 
bridging not less than 2 inches (51 mm) in thickness and of 
the same width as the studs fitted snugly and nailed thereto 
to provide adequate lateral support. Bridging shall be placed 
in every stud cavity and at a frequency such that no stud so 
braced shall have a height-to-least-thickness ratio exceed- 
ing 50 with the height of the stud measured between hori- 



zontal framing and bridging or between bridging, which- 
ever is greater. 

2308.9.10 Cutting and notching. In exterior walls and 
bearing partitions, any wood stud is permitted to be cut or 
notched to a depth not exceeding 25 percent of its width. 
Cutting or notching of studs to a depth not greater than 40 
percent of the width of the stud is permitted in nonbearing 
partitions supporting no loads other than the weight of the 
partition. 

2308.9.11 Bored holes. A hole not greater in diameter than 
40 percent of the stud width is permitted to be bored in any 
wood stud. Bored holes not greater than 60 percent of the 
width of the stud are permitted in nonbearing partitions or in 
any wall where each bored stud is doubled, provided not 
more than two such successive doubled studs are so bored. 

In no case shall the edge of the bored hole be nearer than 
^/g inch (15.9 mm) to the edge of the stud. 

Bored holes shall not be located at the same section of 
stud as a cut or notch. 

2308.10 Roof and ceiling framing. The framing details 
required in this section apply to roofs having a minimum slope 
of three units vertical in 12 units horizontal (25-percent slope) 
or greater. Where the roof slope is less than three units vertical 
in 12 units horizontal (25-percent slope), members supporting 
rafters and ceiling joists such as ridge board, hips and valleys 
shall be designed as beams.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 mile per hour = 1.61 km/h? 1 pound = 0.454 Kg, 1 pound/foot = 14.5939 N/m. 

a. The uplift connection requirements are based on a 30-foot mean roof height located in Exposure B. For Exposure C or D and for other mean roof heights, multiply 
the above loads by the adjustment coefiBcients below.

b. The uplift connection requirements are based on the framing being spaced 24 inches on center. Multiply by 0.67 for framing spaced 1 6 inches on center and multi- 
ply by 0.5 for framing spaced 12 inches on center 

c. The upUft connection requirements include an allowance for 10 pounds of dead load. 

d. The uplift connection requirements do not account for the effects of overhangs. The magnitude of the above loads shall be increased by adding the overhang loads 
found in the table. The overhang loads are also based on framing spaced 24 inches on center. The overhang loads given shall be multiplied by the overhang projec- 
tion and added to the roof uplift value in the table. 

e. The uplift connection requirements are based upon wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 6-2 of ASCE 7. Connection loads for connections located a dis- 
tance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimension of the building from the comer of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table connection 
value by 0.7 and multiplying the overhang load by 0.8. 

f. For wall-to-wall and wall-to-foundation connections, the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds for each full wall above. (For 
example, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the nect floor level down). 

g. Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of basic wind speeds and roof spans. 

h. The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to include up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications. 



2308.10.1 Wind uplift. Roof assemblies shall have rafter 
and truss ties to the wall below. Resultant uplift loads shall 
be transferred to the foundation using a continuous load 
path. The rafter or truss to wall connection shall comply 
with Tables 2304.9.1 and 2308.10.1. 

2308.10.2 Ceiling joist spans. Allowable spans for ceiling 
joists shall be in accordance with Table 2308.10.2(1) or 
2308.10.2(2). For other grades and species, refer to the 
AF&amp;PA Span Tables for Joists and Rafters. 

2308.10.3 Rafter spans. Allowable spans for rafters shall 
be in accordance with Table 2308.10.3(1), 2308.10.3(2), 
2308.10.3(3), 2308.10.3(4), 2308.10.3(5) or 2308.10.3(6). 
For other grades and species, refer to the AF&amp;PA Span 
Tables for Joists and Rafters. 

2308.10.4 Ceiling joist and rafter framing. Rafters shall 
be framed directly opposite each other at the ridge. There 
shall be a ridge board at least 1-inch (25 mm) nominal thick- 
ness at ridges and not less in depth than the cut end of the raf- 
ter. At valleys and hips, there shall be a single valley or hip 
rafter not less than 2-inch (51 mm) nominal thickness and 
not less in depth than the cut end of the rafter. 

2308.10.4.1 Ceiling joist and rafter connections. Ceil- 
ing joists and rafters shall be nailed to each other and the 
assembly shall be nailed to the top wall plate in accor- 
dance with Tables 2304.9. 1 and 2308. 10. 1 . Ceiling joists 
shall be continuous or securely joined where they meet 
over interior partitions and fastened to adjacent rafters in 
accordance with Tables 2308. 10.4.1 and 2304.9.1 to pro- 



vide a continuous rafter tie across the building where 
such joists are parallel to the rafters. Ceiling joists shall 
have a bearing surface of not less than IV2 inches (38 
mm) on the top plate at each end. 

Where ceiling joists are not parallel to rafters, an 
equivalent rafter tie shall be installed in a manner to pro- 
vide a continuous tie across the building, at a spacing of 
not more than 4 feet (1219 mm) o.c. The connections 
shall be in accordance with Tables 2308.10.4.1 and

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound per square foot = 47.8 NAn^. 
I a. 40d box (5" x 0.162") or 16d sinker (SV/' x 0.148") nails are permitted to be substitated for 16d common (SVj" x 0.16") nails. 

b. Nailing requirements are permitted to be reduced 25 percent if nails are clinched. 

c. Rafter tie heel joint connections are not required where the ridge is supported by a load-bearing wall, header or ridge beam. 

d. When intermediate support of the rafter is provided by vertical struts or purlins to a load-bearing wall, the tabulated heel joint connection requirements are permit- 
ted to be reduced proportionally to the reduction in span. 

e. Equivalent nailing patterns are required for ceiling joist to ceiling joist lap splices. 

f. Connected members shall be of sufficient size to prevent splitting due to naihng. 

g. For snow loads less than 30 pounds per square foot, the required number of nails is permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the ratio of actual snow load plus 10 
divided by 40, but not less tiian the number required for no snow load.

the purposes of this section and as used elsewhere in this code, 
have the meanings shown herein: 

AIR-INFLATED STRUCTURE. A building where the shape 
of the structure is maintained by air pressurization of cells or 
tubes to form a barrel vault over the usable area. Occupants of 
such a structure do not occupy the pressurized area used to sup- 
port the structure. 

AIR-SUPPORTED STRUCTURE. A building wherein the 
shape of the structure is attained by air pressure and occupants 
of the structure are within the elevated pressure area. Air-sup- 
ported structures are of two basic types: 

Double skin. Similar to a single skin, but with an attached 
liner that is separated from the outer skin and provides an 
airspace which serves for insulation, acoustic, aesthetic or 
similar purposes. 

Single skin. Where there is only the single outer skin and 
the air pressure is directly against that skin. 

CABLE-RESTRAINED, AIR-SUPPORTED STRUC- 
TURE. A structure in which the uplift is resisted by cables or 
webbings which are anchored to either foundations or dead 
men. Reinforcing cable or webbing is attached by various 
methods to the membrane or is an integral part of the mem- 
brane. This is not a cable-supported structure. 

MEMBRANE-COVERED CABLE STRUCTURE. A 

nonpressurized structure in which a mast and cable system pro- 
vides support and tension to the membrane weather barrier and 
the membrane imparts stability to the structure. 

MEMBRANE-COVERED FRAME STRUCTURE. A 

nonpressurized building wherein the structure is composed of a 



rigid framework to support a tensioned membrane which pro- 
vides the weather barrier. 

NONCOMBUSTIBLE MEMBRANE STRUCTURE. A 

membrane structure in which the membrane and all component 
parts of the structure are noncombustible. 

3102.3 Type of construction. Noncombustible membrane 
structures shall be classified as Type IIB construction. 
Noncombustible frame or cable-supported structures covered

SECTION 3402 
DEFINITIONS 

3402.1 Definitions. The following term shall, for the purposes 
of this chapter and as used elsewhere in the code, have the fol- 
lowing meaning: 

PRIMARY FUNCTION. A primary function is a major activ- 
ity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a pri- 
mary function include, but are not limited to, the customer 
service lobby of a bank, the dining area of a cafeteria, the meet- 
ing rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and other 
work areas in which the activities of the public accommodation 
or other private entity using the facility are carried out. 
Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, 
employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets, 
entrances, corridors and restrooms are not areas containing a 
primary function. 

TECHNICALLY INFEASIBLE. An alteration of a building 
or a facility that has little likelihood of being accomplished 
because the existing structural conditions require the removal 
or alteration of a load-bearing member that is an essential part 
of the structural frame, or because other existing physical or 
site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, 
spaces or features which are in full and strict compliance with 



the minimum requirements for new construction and which are 
necessary to provide accessibility. 



SECTION 3403 
ADDITIONS, ALTERATIONS OR REPAIRS 

3403.1 Existing buildings or structures. Additions or alter- 
ations to any building or structure shall comply with the 
requirements of the code for new construction. Additions or 
alterations shall not be made to an existing building or structure 
that will cause the existing building or structure to be in viola- 
tion of any provisions of this code. An existing building plus 
additions shall comply with the height and area provisions of 
Chapter 5. Portions of the structure not altered and not affected 
by the alteration are not required to comply with the code 
requirements for a new structure. 

3403.1.1 Flood hazard areas. For buildings and structures 
in flood hazard areas established in Section 1612.3, any 
additions, alterations or repairs that constitute substantial 
improvement of the existing structure, as defined in Section 
1612.2, shall comply with the flood design requirements for 
new construction, and all aspects of the existing structure 
shall be brought into compliance with the requirements for 
new construction for flood design. 

3403.2 Structural. Additions or alterations to an existing 
structure shall not increase the force in any structural element 
by more than 5 percent, unless the increased forces on the ele- 
ment are still in compliance with the code for new structures, 
nor shall the strength of any structural element be decreased to 
less than that required by this code for new structures. Where 
repairs are made to structural elements of an existing building, 
and uncovered structural elements are found to be unsound or 
otherwise structurally deficient, such elements shall be made to 
conform to the requirements for new structures. 

3403.2.1 Existing live load. Where an existing structure 
heretofore is altered or repaired, the minimum design loads 
for the structure shall be the loads applicable at the time of 
erection, provided that public safety is not endangered 
thereby. 

3403.2.2 Live load reduction. If the approved live load is 
less than required by Section 1607, the areas designed for 
the reduced live load shall be posted in with the approved 
load. Placards shall be of an approved design. 

3403.2.3 Seismic. Additions, alterations or modification or 
change of occupancy of existing buildings shall be in accor- 
dance with this section for the purposes of seismic consider- 
ations. 

3403.2.3.1 Additions to existing buildings. An addition 
that is structurally independent from an existing struc- 
ture shall be designed and constructed with the seismic 
requirements for new structures. An addition that is not 



2006 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE® 



541 



EXISTING STRUCTURES 



structurally independent from an existing structure shall 
be designed and constructed such that the entire structure 
conforms to the seismic-force-resistance requirements 
for new structures unless the following conditions are 
satisfied: 

1 . The addition conforms with the requirements for 
new structures, 

2. The addition does not increase the seismic forces 
in any structural element of the existing structure 
by more than 10 percent cumulative since the orig- 
inal construction, unless the element has the 
capacity to resist the increased forces determined 
in accordance with ASCE 7, and 

3 . Additions do not decrease the seismic resistance of 
any structural element of the existing structure by 
more than 10 percent cumulative since the original 
construction, unless the element has the capacity 
to resist the forces determined in accordance with 
ASCE 7. If the building's seismic base shear 
capacity has been increased since the original con- 
struction, the percent change in base shear may be 
calculated relative to the increased value. 

3403.2.3.2 Alterations. Alterations are permitted to be 
made to any structure without requiring the structure to 
comply with Section 1613, provided the alterations con- 
form to the requirements for a new structure. Alterations 
that increase the seismic force in any existing structural 
element by more than 10 percent cumulative since the 
original construction or decrease the design strength of 
any existing structural element to resist seismic forces by 
more than 5 percent cumulative since the original con- 
struction shall not be permitted unless the entire seis- 
mic-force-resisting system is determined to conform to 
ASCE 7 for a new structure. If the building's seismic 
base shear capacity has been increased since the original 
construction, the percent change in base shear may be 
calculated relative to the increased value. 

Exception: Alterations to existing structural ele- 
ments or additions of new structural elements that are 
not required by ASCE 7 and are initiated for the pur- 
pose of increasing the strength or stiffness of the seis- 
mic-force-resisting system of an existing structure 
need not be designed for forces conforming to ASCE 
7, provided that an engineering analysis is submitted 
indicating the following: 

1. The design strength of existing structural ele- 
ments required to resist seismic forces is not 
reduced. 

2. The seismic force to required existing structural 
elements is not increased beyond their design 
strength. 

3. New structural elements are detailed and con- 
nected to the existing structural elements as 
required by Chapter 16. 

4. New or relocated nonstructural elements are 
detailed and connected to existing or new struc- 
tural elements as required by Chapter 16. 



5 . The alterations do not create a structural irregu- 
larity as defined in ASCE 7 or make an existing 
structural irregularity more severe. 

6. The alterations do not result in the creation of an 
unsafe condition. 

3403.3 Nonstructural. Nonstructural alterations or repairs to 
an existing building or structure are permitted to be made of the 
same materials of which the building or structure is con- 
structed, provided that they do not adversely affect any struc- 
tural member or the fire-resistance rating of any part of the 
building or structure. 

3403.4 Stairways. An alteration or the replacement of an exist- 
ing stairway in an existing structure shall not be required to 
comply with the requirements of a new stairway as outlined in

3410.1 Compliance, The provisions of this section are 
intended to maintain or increase the current degree of public 
safety, health and general welfare in existing buildings while 
permitting repair, alteration, addition and change of occupancy 



without requiring full compliance with Chapters 2 through 33, 
or Sections 3401.3, and 3403 through 3407, except where com- 
pliance with other provisions of this code is specifically 
required in this section. 

3410.2 Applicability. Structures existing prior to [DATE TO BE 

INSERTED BY THE JURISDICTION. NOTE: IT IS RECOMMENDED 
THAT THIS DATE COINCIDE WITH THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF BUILD- 
ING CODES V^THIN THE JURISDICTION], in which there is work 
involving additions, alterations or changes of occupancy shall 
be made to conform to the requirements of this section or the 
provisions of Sections 3403 through 3407. The provisions in 
Sections 3410.2.1 through 3410.2.5 shall apply to existing 
occupancies that will continue to be, or are proposed to be, in 
Groups A, B, E, F, M, R, S and U. These provisions shall not 
apply to buildings with occupancies in Group H or I. 

3410.2.1 Change in occupancy. Where an existing build- 
ing is changed to a new occupancy classification and this 
section is applicable, the provisions of this section for the 
new occupancy shall be used to determine compliance with 
this code. 

3410.2.2 Partial change in occupancy. Where a portion of 
the building is changed to a new occupancy classification, 
and that portion is separated from the remainder of the 
building with fire barriers or horizontal assemblies having a 
fire-resistance rating as required by Table 508.3.3 for the 
separate occupancies, or with approved compliance alterna- 
tives, the portion changed shall be made to conform to the 
provisions of this section. 

Where a portion of the building is changed to a new occu- 
pancy classification, and that portion is not separated from 
the remainder of the building with fire barriers or horizontal 
assemblies having a fire-resistance rating as required by 
Table 508.3.3 for the separate occupancies, or with 
approved compliance alternatives, the provisions of this 
section which apply to each occupancy shall apply to the 
entire building. Where there are conflicting provisions, 
those requirements which secure the greater public safety 
shall apply to the entire building or structure. 

3410.2.3 Additions. Additions to existing buildings shall 
comply with the requirements of this code for new construc- 
tion. The combined height and area of the existing building 
and the new addition shall not exceed the height and area 
allowed by Chapter 5. Where a fire wall that comphes with 
Section 705 is provided between the addition and the exist- 
ing building, the addition shall be considered a separate 
building. 

3410.2.4 Alterations and repairs. An existing building or 
portion thereof, which does not comply with the require- 
ments of this code for new construction, shall not be altered 
or repaired in such a manner that results in the building 
being less safe or sanitary than such building is currently. If, 
in the alteration or repair, the current level of safety or sani- 
tation is to be reduced, the portion altered or repaired shall 
conform to the requirements of Chapters 2 through 12 and 
Chapters 14 through 33. 

3410.2.4.1 Flood hazard areas. For existing buildings 
located in flood hazard areas established in Section

buildings proposed for change of occupancy shall conform 
to the accessibility provisions of Chapter 1 1 . 

3410.3 Acceptance. For repairs, alterations, additions and 
changes of occupancy to existing buildings that are evaluated 
in accordance with this section, compliance with this section 
shall be accepted by the building official. 

3410.3.1 Hazards. Where the building official determines 
that an unsafe condition exists, as provided for in Section 
115, such unsafe condition shall be abated in accordance 
with Section 115. 

3410.3.2 Compliance with other codes. Buildings that are 
evaluated in accordance with this section shall comply with 
the International Fire Code and International Property 
Maintenance Code. 

3410.4 Investigation and evaluation. For proposed work cov- 
ered by this section, the building owner shall cause the existing 
building to be investigated and evaluated in accordance with 
the provisions of this section. 

3410.4.1 Structural analysis. The owner shall have a struc- 
tural analysis of the existing building made to determine 
adequacy of structural systems for the proposed alteration, 
addition or change of occupancy. The existing building shall 
be capable of supporting the minimum load requirements of 
Chapter 16. 

3410.4.2 Submittal. The results of the investigation and 
evaluation as required in Section 3410.4, along with pro- 
posed compliance alternatives, shall be submitted to the 
building official. 

3410.4.3 Determination of compliance. The building offi- 
cial shall determine whether the existing building, with the 
proposed addition, alteration or change of occupancy, com- 
plies with the provisions of this section in accordance with 
the evaluation process in Sections 3410.5 through 3410.9. 

3410.5 Evaluation. The evaluation shall be comprised of three 
categories: fire safety, means of egress and general safety, as 
defined in Sections 3410.5.1 through 3410.5.3. 

3410.5.1 Fire safety. Included within the fire safety cate- 
gory are the structural fire resistance, automatic fire detec- 
tion, fire alarm and fire suppression system features of the 
facility. 

3410.5.2 Means of egress. Included within the means of 
egress category are the configuration, characteristics and 
support features for means of egress in the facility. 

3410.5.3 General safety. Included within the general safety 
category are the fire safety parameters and the means of 
egress parameters. 

3410.6 Evaluation process. The evaluation process specified 
herein shall be followed in its entirety to evaluate existing 
buildings. Table 3410.7 shall be utilized for tabulating the 
results of the evaluation. References to other sections of this 
code indicate that compliance with those sections is required in 



order to gain credit in the evaluation herein outlined. In apply- 
ing this section to a building with mixed occupancies, where 
the separation between the mixed occupancies does not qualify 
for any category indicated in Section 3410.6.16, the score for 
each occupancy shall be determined and the lower score deter- 
mined for each section of the evaluation process shall apply to 
the entire building. 

Where the separation between the mixed occupancies quali- 
fies for any category indicated in Section 3410.6.16, the score 
for each occupancy shall apply to each portion of the building 
based on the occupancy of the space. 

3410.6.1 Building height. The value for building height 
shall be the lesser value determined by the formula in Sec- 
tion 3410.6.1.1. Chapter 5 shall be used to determine the 
allowable height of the building, including allowable 
increases due to automatic sprinklers as provided for in Sec- 
tion 504.2. Subtract the actual building height from the 
allowable and divide by 12 V2 feet. Enter the height value 
and its sign (positive or negative) in Table 3410.7 under 
Safety Parameter 3410.6.1, Building Height, for fire safety, 
means of egress and general safety. The maximum score for 
a building shall be 10. 

3410.6.1.1 Height formula. The following formulas 
shall be used in computing the building height value. 

Height value, feet = ^^^~^ ^^^ x CF 

Height value, stories =(A5 - EBS) x CF 

(Equation 34-1) 

where: 

AH = Allowable height in feet from Table 503. 

EBH = Existing building height in feet. 

AS = Allowable height in stories from Table 503. 

EBS = Existing building height in stories. 

CF = 1 if (AH) - (EBH) is positive. 

CF = Construction-type factor shown in Table 
3410.6.6(2) if (AH) - (EBH) is negative. 

Note: Where mixed occupancies are separated and indi- 
vidually evaluated as indicated in Section 3410.6, the 
values AH, AS, EBH and EBS shall be based on the 
height of the fire area of the occupancy being evaluated. 

3410.6.2 Building area. The value for building area shall be 
determined by the formula in Section 3410.6.2.2. Section 
503 and the formula in Section 3410.6.2.1 shall be used to 
determine the allowable area of the building. This shall 
include any allowable increases due to open perimeter and 
automatic sprinklers as provided for in Section 506. Sub- 
tract the actual building area from the allowable area and 
divide by 1,200 square feet (112 m^). Enter the area value 
and its sign (positive or negative) in Table 3410.7 under 
Safety Parameter 3410.6.2, Building Area, for fire safety, 
means of egress and general safety. In determining the area 
value, the maximum permitted positive value for area is 50 
percent of the fire safety score as listed in Table 3410.8, 
Mandatory Safety Scores.

(Equation 34-2) 



where: 

AA = Allowable area. 

SP = Percent increase for sprinklers (Section 506.3). 

OP = Percent increase for open perimeter (Section 
506.2). 

3410.6.2.2 Area formula. The following formula shall 
be used in computing the area value. Determine the area 
value for each occupancy fire area on a floor-by-floor 
basis. For each occupancy, choose the minimum area 
value of the set of values obtained for the particular occu- 
pancy.

arate compartments shall be a fire barrier conforming to 
Section 706 with a fire-resistance rating of not less than 2 
hours. Where the building is not divided into more than 
one compartment, the compartment size shall be taken as 
the total floor area on all floors. Where there is more than 
one compartment within a story, each compartmented 
area on such story shall be provided with a horizontal exit 
conforming to Section 1022. The fire door serving as the 
horizontal exit between compartments shall be so 
installed, fitted and gasketed that such fire door will pro- 
vide a substantial barrier to the passage of smoke. 

3410.6.3.2 Floor/ceiling construction. A floor/ceiling 
assembly used to create compartments shall conform to 
Section 711 and shall have a fire-resistance rating of not 
less than 2 hours.

ol Perpose. The purpose of this appendix is to promote 
the pubHc health, safety and general welfare and to minimize 
public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific 
flood hazard areas through the establishment of comprehen- 
sive regulations for management of flood hazard areas 
designed to: 

1 . Prevent unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and 
public service during times of flooding; 

2. Manage the alteration of natural flood plains, stream 
channels and shorelines; 

3. Manage filling, grading, dredging and other develop- 
ment which may increase flood damage or erosion 
potential; 

4. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers 
which will divert floodwaters or which can increase 
flood hazards; and 

5. Contribute to improved construction techniques in the 
flood plain. 



G1(D)1.2 OlbjectnveSo The objectives of this appendix are to pro- 
tect human Ufe, minimize the expenditure of public money for 
flood control projects, minimize the need for rescue and relief 
efforts associated with flooding, minimize prolonged business 
interruption, minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, 
help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use 
and development of flood-prone areas, contribute to improved 
construction techniques in the flood plain and ensure that 
potential owners and occupants are notified that property is 
within flood hazard areas. 



3 Scope, The provisions of this appendix shall apply to 
all proposed development in a flood hazard area established in 
Section 1612 of this code, including certain building work 
exempt from permit under Section 105.2. 



IS. Any violation of a provision of this appen- 
dix, or failure to comply with a permit or variance issued pursu- 
ant to this appendix or any requirement of this appendix, shall 
be handled in accordance with Section 113.

areas are established in Section 1612.3 of the International 
Building Code, adopted by the governing body on [INSERT 
DATE]. 



POWERS kMB DUTDES 

G103ol Permalt applkaitjomso The building official shall 
review all permit applications to determine whether proposed 
development sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a 
proposed development site is in a flood hazard area, all site 
development activities (including grading, filling, utility 
installation and drainage modification), all new construction 
and substantial improvements (including the placement of pre- 
fabricated buildings and manufactured homes) and certain 
building work exempt from permit under Section 105.2 shall be 
designed and constructed with methods, practices and materi- 
als that minimize flood damage and that are in accordance with 
this code and ASCE 24. 



It shall be the responsibility of the 
building official to assure that approval of a proposed develop- 
ment shall not be given until proof that necessary permits have 
been granted by federal or state agencies having jurisdiction 
over such development. 

Gl(D)3o3 Deteomiiiiatioiii of desigm ffloodl elevaltioinis. If design 
flood elevations are not specified, the building official is autho- 
rized to require the applicant to: 

1. Obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available 
from a federal, state or other source, or 

2. Determine the design flood elevation in accordance with 
accepted hydrologic and hydraulic engineering tech- 
niques. Such analyses shall be performed and sealed by a 
registered design professional. Studies, analyses and 
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to 
allow review and approval by the building official. The 
accuracy of data submitted for such determination shall 
be the responsibility of the applicant. 



m. riverime IHood hazairdl areas. In riverine 
flood hazard areas where design flood elevations are specified 
but floodways have not been designated, the building official 
shall not permit any new construction, substantial improve- 
ment or other development, including fill, unless the applicant 
demonstrates that the cumulative effect of the proposed devel-

APPEND8X G 



opment, when combined with all other existing and anticipated 
flood hazard area encroachment, will not increase the design 
flood elevation more than 1 foot (305 mm) at any point within 
the community. 

G1®3.S Floodway encroachment. Prior to issuing a permit for 
any floodway encroachment, including fill, new construction, 
substantial improvements and other development or land-dis- 
turbing activity, the building official shall require submission 
of a certification, along with supporting technical data, that 
demonstrates that such development will not cause any 
increase of the level of the base flood. 



ms. A floodway encroachment 
that increases the level of the base flood is authorized if the 
applicant has applied for a conditional Flood Insurance Rate 
Map (FIRM) revision and has received the approval of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 

G103.6 Watercourse alteration. Prior to issuing a permit for 
any alteration or relocation of any watercourse, the building 
official shall require the applicant to provide notification of the 
proposal to the appropriate authorities of all affected adjacent 
government jurisdictions, as well as appropriate state agencies. 
A copy of the notification shall be maintained in the permit 
records and submitted to FEMA. 

Gl©3«6.1 Emgineering analysis. The building official shall 
require submission of an engineering analysis which dem- 
onstrates that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or 
relocated portion of the watercourse will not be decreased. 
Such watercourses shall be maintained in a manner which 
preserves the channel's flood-carrying capacity. 

G103.7 Alterations in coastal areas. Prior to issuing a permit 
for any alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands in flood 
hazard areas subject to high velocity wave action, the building 
official shall require submission of an engineering analysis 
which demonstrates that the proposed alteration will not 
increase the potential for flood damage. 

G103.8 Records. The building official shall maintain a perma- 
nent record of all permits issued in flood hazard areas, includ- 
ing copies of inspection reports and certifications required in 
Section 1612.

ard areas, floodway boundaries, flood zones, design 
flood elevations, ground elevations, proposed fill and 
excavation and drainage patterns and facilities. 

4. Indicate the use and occupancy for which the proposed 
development is intended. 

5. Be accompanied by construction documents, grading 
and filling plans and other information deemed appropri- 
ate by the building official. 

6. State the valuation of the proposed work. 

7. Be signed by the applicant or the applicant's authorized 
agent.

1.3 Validity of permit. The issuance of a permit under this 
appendix shall not be construed to be a permit for, or approval 
of, any violation of this appendix or any other ordinance of the 
jurisdiction. The issuance of a permit based on submitted docu- 
ments and information shall not prevent the building official 
from requiring the correction of errors. The building official is 
authorized to prevent occupancy or use of a structure or site 
which is in violation of this appendix or other ordinances of this 
jurisdiction. 



.4 Expiration. A permit shall become invalid if the pro- 
posed development is not commenced within 180 days after its 
issuance, or if the work authorized is suspended or abandoned 
for a period of 180 days after the work commences. Extensions 
shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demon- 
strated. The building official is authorized to grant, in writing, 
one or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 180 
days each. 

G104.5 Suspension or revocation. The building official is 
authorized to suspend or revoke a permit issued under this 
appendix wherever the permit is issued in error or on the basis 
of incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete information, or in viola- 
tion of any ordinance or code of this jurisdiction.

preservation program that is approved by the Depart- 
ment of Interior. 



A variance is 

authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial 
improvement of a functionally dependent facility provided the 
criteria in Section 1612. 1 are met and the variance is the mini- 
mum necessary to allow the construction or substantial 
improvement, and that all due consideration has been given to 
methods and materials that minimize flood damages during the 
design flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 



The board of appeals shall not issue a 
variance for any proposed development in a floodway if any 
increase in flood levels would result during the base flood dis- 
charge. 



3o In reviewing applications for vari- 
ances, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evalua- 
tions, all relevant factors, all other portions of this appendix and 
the following: 

1 . The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto 
other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 

2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or ero- 
sion damage; 

3. The susceptibility of the proposed development, 
including contents, to flood damage and the effect of 
such damage on current and future owners; 

4. The importance of the services provided by the pro- 
posed development to the community; 

5. The availability of alternate locations for the proposed 
development that are not subject to flooding or erosion; 

6. The compatibility of the proposed development with 
existing and anticipated development; 

7. The relationship of the proposed development to the 
comprehensive plan and flood plain management pro- 
gram for that area; 

8 . The safety of access to the property in times of flood for 
ordinary and emergency vehicles; 

9. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise 
and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters 
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at 
the site; and 

10. The costs of providing governmental services during 
and after flood conditions including maintenance and 



DSo7 ComdHMoinis for nssiiamiceo Variances shall only be 
issued by the board of appeals upon: 

1 . A technical showing of good and sufficient cause that the 
unique characteristics of the size, configuration or 
topography of the site renders the elevation standards 
inappropriate; 

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would 
result in exceptional hardship by rendering the lot 
undevelopable; 

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not 
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to 
public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create 
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public 
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; 

4. A determination that the variance is the minimum neces- 
sary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and 

5 . Notification to the applicant in writing over the signature 
of the building official that the issuance of a variance to 
construct a structure below the base flood level will 
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up 
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance cover- 
age, and that such construction below the base flood 
level increases risks to life and property.
